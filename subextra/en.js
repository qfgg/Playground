00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,717
We will take the very best care of her,
as if she was our own daughter.

647
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,973
Now, Zhang Li, are you ready to go down
and see the Chapel?

648
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:02,890
Yes.

649
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,395
[Paloma] The day students you study with
are unlikely to ever see this.

650
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,815
Spectacular, isn't it?

651
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,819
Converted from a chapel
nearly a hundred years ago.

652
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,781
Based on the Musikverein in Vienna.

653
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,285
Zhang Li, come here. Come up here.

654
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:25,955
Come on. Come.

655
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,916
Okay, now stand right here.

656
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,209
Right here.

657
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,879
And I want you to sing a note.

658
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,964
Hm. A sharp.

659
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,215
Hm.

660
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:40,887
Sing.

661
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,765
[singing]

662
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,853
Doesn't that sound incredible?

663
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,107
I believe this to be the most...

664
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,402
acoustically perfect room
I've ever been in.

665
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,571
-[Zhang Li] It's beautiful.
-And...

666
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,448
very few students

667
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,075
are invited to play here.

668
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:07,371
It takes years and years
of intense practice.

669
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,664
But the best,

670
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,541
the very best,

671
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,043
Lizzie, for example,

672
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,754
Charlotte Willmore, before her.

673
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,299
If you are as exceptional

674
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:22,720
as they are, and Zhang Li,
I believe you may be,

675
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,182
well, then you can have the chance
to perform here

676
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,517
and then you can have the chance...

677
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,978
for greatness.

678
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,295
[doorbell buzzes]

679
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,550
[buzzing continues]

680
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,391
Hello.

681
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,937
[doorbell buzzes]

682
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,022
Hello, who is it?

683
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,277
[groans]

684
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,613
Who is it, please?

685
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,574
[clears throat] Hello.

686
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:29,787
Who is it?

687
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,505
Oh, my God.

688
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,674
Where have you been?

689
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,386
What's... What's happened to you?
We've been looking for you.

690
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,472
Elizabeth.

691
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,019
What happened to your hand?

692
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,444
[shouts]
What the hell happened to your hand?

693
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,197
They found me on the side of a mountain.

694
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,034
Drugged out of my mind.

695
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,995
Covered in blood.

696
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,167
With nothing but a homemade tourniquet
keeping me alive.

697
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,838
The police tried to help me, but...

698
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,967
I'm the one who took the pills.

699
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,094
I'm the one who...

700
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,388
chopped my own hand off.

701
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,476
Once I woke up in the hospital, and...

702
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,105
once the drugs were out of my system,
and I could think clearly again...

703
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,109
Charlotte was already out of the country.

704
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,070
I still can't understand.

705
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,155
Why? Why would she do this?

706
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,074
Because...

707
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,702
Because she's a jealous fucking bitch!

708
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,413
I had...

709
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,583
music, fame...

710
00:47:58,793 --> 00:47:59,794
you.

711
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,129
And she couldn't stand that.

712
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,673
She couldn't stand
that I replaced her. She...

713
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,427
tracked me down to China, befriended me,

714
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,389
slept with me, poisoned me.

715
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,184
All that because I had the life
that she so desperately wanted.

716
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,852
My God. God.

717
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,730
[cries]
And now it's gone. It is...

718
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,941
It is completely gone.

719
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,943
Elizabeth, it's...

720
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,694
It's going to be okay.

721
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,863
She took everything from me.

722
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,533
Everything!

723
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,547

[cello playing]

729
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,625
[Anton] More tension.

730
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:23,794
Yes.

731
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,089
Good. Good.

732
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,175
Play through the pain. Good.

733
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,684
Right.

734
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:40,478
Don't...

735
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,910
Actually, Elizabeth,
when practice is over,

736
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,786
do you have a minute to talk?

737
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,208
[door closes]

738
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,461
I don't understand.

739
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,756
You're kicking me out?

740
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,717
I have nowhere to go.

741
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,177
We found you a place.

742
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,055
By the museum,
right next to Central Avenue T Station.

743
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,139
We'll pay for it.

744
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,391
Pay for all of it.
Pay for your rehabilitation.

745
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,353
But I can still be useful, Anton.
I can teach.

746
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,606
Music is my life.

747
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,690
Look at us.

748
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,776
You know what this is.

749
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,028
How we work here.

750
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,696
We have Theis and Geoffrey.

751
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,698
We don't need any more teachers.

752
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,076
But I can conduct, and I can compose.

753
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,285
Fuck, I'll scrub the toilets!

754
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,454
Just don't... Don't shut me out.

755
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,374
[sobs] Please.

756
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,251
Anton...

757
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,753
if you accept me,

758
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,797
the music world will accept me.

759
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,132
Don't you understand that?

760
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,885
You have that power.

761
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,762
You have that reputation.

762
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,223
Your word means so much,

763
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,642
but if you shut me out...

764
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,228
[sobs] Please.

765
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,314
Please.

766
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,234
Don't be this person.

767
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,028
Do not discard me.

768
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,574
Lizzie, this is a music conservatory,
not a convalescent home.

769
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,287
I'm sorry.

770
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,872
I didn't mean it like that,

771
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,584
but there are other girls
that we need to house and train.

772
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,380
Anton...

773
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,675
Please. [sobs]

774
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,679
I don't know anything else.

775
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,057
You had a gift.

776
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,394
A rare and...

777
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,273
beautiful talent like no other.

778
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,360
But sadly, that gift is gone.

779
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,073
I'm so sorry, Elizabeth.

780
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,580
[softly] Please.

Fuck you. You fucking bitch!

[Paloma] Anton.

797
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:35,999
What's going on?

798
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:42,923
Anton.

799
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,966
Stay here.

800
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,471
Lizzie.

801
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,474
What are you doing here?

802
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,726
You're gonna freeze to death.

803
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,441
Look, I know this is hard,
but I thought I made myself clear.

804
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,985
You just can't be here.

805
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,362
Because I had nothing you wanted.

806
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,656
Now I do.

807
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,867
What are you talking about?

808
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:12,661
What do you have?

809
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,790
I have the bitch.

810
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,502
Oh, my God.

811
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,047
Lizzie, what have you done?

812
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,091
Where is she?

813
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:29,803
Where is she?

814
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,683
In the trunk of my fucking car.

815
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,733
So I can come home?

00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,663
Where is she?

817
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:00,042
She's with Paloma, but don't worry.

818
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,419
She... She can't hurt you.

819
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,837
But she's crazy.

820
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,006
She kidnapped me, Anton.

821
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,050
I know. She's not well. Clearly.

822
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,761
But frankly,

823
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,971
neither are you.

824
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,100
Were you really that jealous?

825
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,478
I wasn't jealous.

826
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,564
I was trying to help her.

827
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,734
By cutting off her hand?

828
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,531
I saw her picture in a magazine.

829
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,700
I saw the tattoo on her back.

830
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,911
The same as mine.

831
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,623
I knew how she got it.

832
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,044
I knew what she had to do to get it.

833
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,965
And I knew she was brainwashed
just like I was

834
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,926
until my mom got sick
and I had to go home.

835
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,556
<i>I sat in that room with my mother</i>
<i>for a decade, slowly going crazy.</i>

836
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,142
<i>I blamed myself for everything.</i>

837
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:03,730
<i>I spent years in and out of</i>
<i>mental hospitals until, finally,</i>

838
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,899
<i>with some help, I saw the light.</i>

839
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,528
So I reached out...

840
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,823
and came back into your lives.

841
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,744
Came back why?

842
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,041
Came back why, Charlotte?

843
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,751
To help save her.

844
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,753
Save her from what?

845
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,048
From you.

846
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,928
[stammers]

847
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,434
[stammers and laughs]

848
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,439
[laughs]

849
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,283
[sighs deeply]

850
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,709
[cello playing]

851
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,046
[Anton] Very good.

852
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,091
Very good.

853
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:15,677
Back straight now.

854
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,805
Excellent.

855
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,767
More tension in the strings.

856
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,271
Feel it happening inside of you,
Charlotte.

857
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:29,441
Mm-hmm.

858
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,776
Yes.

859
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:32,694
Good.

860
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,498
I made a mistake.

861
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,582
Yes, you did.

862
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,835
I'm sorry.

863
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,420
And after all this time.

864
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,172
-Forgive me.
-After all this training.

865
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,465
Forgive me, Anton.

866
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,926
After a promise for Carnegie Hall.

867
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,890
[groans] Stop. Stop the crying.

868
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,351
[sobs]

869
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,644
Ouch.

870
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,355
[yells] Stop the fucking crying!

871
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,148
It won't happen again.

872
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,275
In this room, it had better not.

873
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,485
Never in this room.

874
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,070
Because you know what happens next.

875
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,780
-Yes, I do.
-Do you?

876
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,115
Yes.

877
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,950
[footsteps approach]

878
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,788
We don't make mistakes here.

879
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,209
Not when we represent the Academy.

880
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,679
Whose name is on that gate?

881
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,765
-Yours.
-Yes.

882
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,227
Mine, my father's, grandfather's.

883
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,187
This school is my blood.

884
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,856
It's my history.

885
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,485
I teach you the way they taught me,
the way they taught Theis and Geoffrey,

886
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,614
and anyone who's fortunate enough
to earn their place here.

887
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,741
But I can only take you so far.

888
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:02,951
I will work harder.

889
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,996
Oh, you will work harder.

890
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,499
Why do we work so hard, Charlotte?

891
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,626
To be the best.

892
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,253
And why is that, Charlotte?

893
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,008
Because it's what's expected of us.

894
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,100
You got that tattoo because

895
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:31,813
you were ready to play in this Chapel.

896
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,274
You got that tattoo...

897
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,651
because you were the very best.

898
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,486
Yes, I know.

899
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,197
And If you're not the very best,

900
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,324
if you insult me...

901
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,744
and Theis and Geoffrey with your mistakes?

902
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,246
I discredit the Academy.

903
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:50,832
Why?

904
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:56,087
Because I was prepared for
The Perfection and failed.

905
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:02,344
Prepared by our sweat,
passion, and reputation.

906
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,139
Prepared by our sweat and passion
and reputation.

907
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,350
Month after month, year after year.

908
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,896
Month after month, year after year.

909
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,522
[Anton]
Until you were ready.

910
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,276
Until I was ready.

911
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,675
[Anton] You failed.

912
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,468
You failed.

913
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,431
So what does that mean?

914
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,685
What does that mean, Charlotte?

915
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,855
When you fail
at the things that we teach you?

916
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,025
I cannot get close to God.

917
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,027
No, you cannot.

918
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,488
And your talent will lay in waste.

919
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,408
Squandered by your lack of ambition.

920
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,743
So what happens now?

921
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,288
-Now?
-Yes, what happens now?

922
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,165
What happened to me,
what happened to Theis and Geoffrey?

923
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:18,128
And every one of the chosen who failed?

924
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,217
We pay the price.

925
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,852
You pay the price.

926
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,147
[muffled screaming]

927
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,941
[sobbing]

928
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,653
[grunting]

929
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,544
[Anton grunts]

930
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,504
[grunts]

931
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:04,716
[grunts]

932
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:46,049
Tonight, Charlotte, after so many years,

933
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,593
you shall play for us again.

934
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,888
I can't.

935
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,017
-I'm not ready.
-Sonata for solo cello.

936
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,228
I'm not ready to play here, Anton.

937
01:04:58,812 --> 01:04:59,979
Please.

938
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,650
Well, here is where you must play.
Where you've always played.

939
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,069
Theis, Geoffrey.

940
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:06,986
No.

941
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,371
And, of course, Paloma.

942
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,291
Please.

943
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,211
Paloma, you can stop this.

944
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:24,963
Please.

945
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,340
We do what we need to do, Charlotte.

946
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,009
It's what's expected of us.

947
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,015
Paloma's always adored
when you played perfectly. Well..

948
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,475
we all did.

949
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,019
That was always the goal.

950
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,104
Right, Charlotte?

951
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,481
The Perfection.

952
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,652
This doesn't have to be like this, Anton.

953
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,450
You really hate me, don't you?

954
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,827
You...

955
01:05:55,910 --> 01:06:00,039
you hate me,
when all I ever did was believe in you.

956
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,542
You know what you did to me.

957
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,003
And you know it helped you become

958
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,130
the rare talent that you were.

959
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,923
I was a child.

960
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,843
Lizzie was a child. We were children.

961
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,637
You were students who achieved greatness.

962
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,348
Just as my grandfather envisioned.

963
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,684
Just like my father taught me.

964
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,354
Everybody should be so lucky.

965
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,690
Lizzie.

966
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,151
Were you abused?

967
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,696
Is that what you would call it,
what we did for you?

968
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:39,954
To play that music,

969
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,291
to achieve The Perfection...

970
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,380
it was a gift.

971
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,387
You see, Charlotte?

972
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,599
You cut off her hand for nothing.

973
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,435
Lizzie, if you would.

974
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:08,399
Well, you must remember our...

975
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:12,278
little rituals. The drinks, the formality.

976
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,156
Consequences.

977
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,160
Oh, but you were just a child then.

978
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,622
Most things really have not changed.

979
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,374
Well, actually...

980
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,085
there is one thing that has changed.

981
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,381
If you achieve The Perfection,

982
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,968
which is what's expected
of you this evening, then...

983
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,971
you can go.

984
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,933
