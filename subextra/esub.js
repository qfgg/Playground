Yeah, I gotta make sure I'm the most
prepared attorney in the courtroom

165
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,676
once my trial starts.

166
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,180
Why did she pick you out of the lineup?

167
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,351
My lawyer found out that the police 
showed her my picture beforehand.

168
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,604
Twice.

169
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,898
<i>Of course I looked familiar.</i>

170
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,568
That's not even the worst part, Liz.

171
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,571
What happened in Utah

172
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,489
wasn't just dumb luck.

173
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,368
The police already had my name.

174
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,746
Someone gave it to them.

175
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,169
Someone gave your name
to the authorities in Utah?

176
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,086
Mm-hmm.

177
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,505
Do you have any idea
who'd do that to you?

178
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,886
Look, do you see that car out there?

179
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,098
It's been following me since I got back.

180
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,143
[snorts] Either I'm going crazy

181
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,770
or I'm being set up.

182
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,107
Done!

183
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,317
It's a thresher shark.

184
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,611
They have a tail
as long as their whole body.

185
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,447
A tail as long as their whole body?
That's crazy!

186
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,574
How the heck did you get
so smart?

187
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,201
I get it from my mom.

188
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,078
You do, don't you?

189
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,913
[both laughing]

190
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:27,872
Aw.

191
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,378
Everything is gonna be okay.

192
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,467
Uh, excuse me, sir.

193
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,177
Could you come with me, please?

194
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,512
Is there something wrong?

195
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,806
Just come with me, please.
Bring your coat.

196
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,309
Okay.

197
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,401
You know this is ridiculous, right?

198
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,569
We're closing soon anyway.

199
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,279
So, it's just better for everybody.

200
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,989
Oh, really? You're closing?

201
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,367
You close in 45 minutes.

202
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,202
[car starting]

203
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,248
Hey!

204
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,167
Hey, hey!

205
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,668
Who are you?

206
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,836
Hey, stop! Hey!

207
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,296
I know you're following me!

208
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,215
What are you-- Who sent you?

209
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,977
[papers rustling]

210
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,730
What are you doing?

211
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
Reading. I'm prepping for the trial.

212
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,027
-With a flashlight under the sheets?
-Yeah, I didn't wanna wake you up.

213
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,990
[both laughing]

214
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,158
You okay?

215
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,160
Uh...

216
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,204
I think we should get married.

217
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,293
[giggling]

218
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,677
Why is this happening right now?

219
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,263
A couple of college girls
disappeared last year

220
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,265
around the University of Washington.

221
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,808
And two more girls

222
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:38,187
vanished in broad daylight
in a crowded state park in, uh...

223
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,481
near Seattle. You remember that?

224
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,567
-Lake... Lake Sammamish?
-Yeah.

225
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,862
Witnesses say
some guy was asking girls to, uh...

226
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,115
help him put a sailboat on top of a car,
and police put out a sketch.

227
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,576
I had the same car as the suspect,
a VW Bug...

228
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,620
and my friends teased me about 
the resemblance to the sketch.

229
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,039
But, geez, nobody was serious.

230
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,291
Someone must have been.

231
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,836
Because your name landed
on a suspect list in Seattle.

232
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,881
When Utah police got wind of that...

233
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,008
they started looking at you
with a lot more interest,

234
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,844
because something similar
is happening to the girls right here.

235
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,803
[exhaling]

236
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,055
I was kicking him and screaming.

237
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,559
He held a small black gun
to my head and said,

238
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,228
"If you don't stop screaming

239
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,688
I'm going to kill you.

240
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,482
I'll blow your brains out."

241
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,068
Then I fell backwards out of his car 
and ran as fast as I could.

242
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,488
As best you recall, Carol...

243
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,991
is the man who approached you
present in court today?

244
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,744
Mm-hmm.

245
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,828
Yes.

246
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,331
Can you point where he's seated?

247
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,841
Let the record state the identification
of the defendant.

248
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,057
No more questions, Your Honor.

249
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,725
Hi, Miss Daronch.

250
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,603
Had the police shown you
a picture of my client

251
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,065
prior to your identification of him 
at the October 2nd lineup?

252
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:05,942
[Carol] Yes.

253
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,236
You did in fact
pick his picture out of a pile

254
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,987
but when asked specifically

255
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,282
why you chose his picture, you stated

256
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,954
"It looks something like him,
but I really couldn't say for sure."

257
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,622
Is that correct?

258
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,333
Mm-hmm.

259
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,046
The only remotely corroborative evidence
you provided was a make of a vehicle.

260
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,383
It's a Volkswagen, one of the most popular
cars in America.

261
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,136
Yet his Volkswagen looks
nothing like your description.

262
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,429
How do you square that?

263
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,891
[Carol, quietly] 
They told me it was supposed to be--

264
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,810
Hmm. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

265
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,064
They told me it was supposed
to be the car.

266
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,816
Who did?

267
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,651
Who told you that, Miss Daronch?

268
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,445
[Carol sobbing]

269
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,615
[sniffling]

270
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,909
We all sympathize with your pain.

271
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,078
It is horrible what you went through.

272
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,830
But the fact of the matter is

273
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,582
you identified my client

274
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,959
because law enforcement 
wanted you to, didn't you?

275
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,295
I... [sobs] 

276
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,048
No. No further questions, Your Honor.

277
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,100
[Liz] I know the trial 
seems to be going well,

278
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,102
but you sure
you want to do this right now?

279
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,854
-[dogs barks echoing]
-Just because we don't have the house yet,

280
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,689
doesn't mean we can't look for the dog. 

281
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
-Right?
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

Ah!

- Hi, stranger.
- Oh, my God. Hi. Wow.

[Ted chuckles]

286
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,993
What are you-- What are you doing here?

287
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,328
Do you live in Utah now?

288
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,081
No. I'm just visiting
some friends that work here.

289
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,375
-Great.
-Hi.

290
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,419
I'm Liz.

291
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,587
Yes, this is...

my girlfriend. We just got engaged so...

293
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,927
Carole Ann and I used to work together

294
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,389
at the Department of Emergency Services
in Olympia years ago.

295
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,641
Oh, that's nice.

296

297
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,853
Everything is gonna be okay, you know?

00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,564
We're all behind you. One hundred percent.

299
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,108
Whoever this woman is
who's accusing you...

300
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm sure she's just gotten you mixed up
with another handsome stranger.

301
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,614
Right.

302
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,033
Well, I'm gonna take
this handsome stranger...

303
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,494
and, yeah, it was nice
to meet you, Carole Ann.

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,857
I need a drink.

641
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,400
You already had one.

642
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,487
Since when is it a crime to take
the edge off every once in a while?

643
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,949
Since your little girl started asking
why her mommy is so sad.

644
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,034
And it's not just once in a while.

645
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,329
So don't soft-pedal this 
and make me out to be the bad guy.

646
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,747
You do this every day.

647
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,249
You read those letters from Ted,

648
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,792
you drink, you cry...

649
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,001
I take care of myself.

650
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,127
I'm a good mother.

651
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,463
You are a great mother,

652
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,423
but you are in denial.

653
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,885
What is it about this guy?

654
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,178
[scoffs]

655
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,771
When I feel his love...

656
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,942
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

657
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,652
And when I don't,

658
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,696
I feel like I'm nothing.

659
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,368
What if the only thing he's guilty of
 is running a stop sign?

660
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,456
He's been convicted
of attempted abduction in Utah...

661
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,126
accused of murder in Colorado,

662
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,878
his name is being tossed around

663
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,006
in connection to other murders
in other states. Liz...

664
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,802
You know this didn't start
with a stop sign.

[Liz] I'm sorry, I--

681
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,573
I didn't get you anything.

682
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,160
You brought me the only thing I wanted
in the entire world.

683
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,414
Gonna open it?

684
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,875
Yeah.

685
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,299
I've read it four times.

686
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,261
You remember what it's about, don't you?

687
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,472
Never lose hope.

688
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,265
You haven't...

689
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,434
have you?

690
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,981
I know this is hard.

691
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,360
Believe me, it's hard for me too.

692
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,695
It's so hard.

693
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,572
And running was foolish of me.

694
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,993
But you weren't answering my calls.

695
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,957
I didn't know what to do.
I thought I was...

696
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,500
going to lose you.

697
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,585
-I got scared.
-Your lawyer called...

698
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,297
and he said the Utah appeal was rejected.

699
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,265
I'm going to take this all the way
to the Supreme Court.

700
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,975
They're not giving you probation.

701
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,393
They're giving you 15 years.

702
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,477
That's a maximum.

703
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,645
That's a maximum, okay?

704
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,856
No one gets a max
on their first conviction.

705
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,858
And you're facing 90 more for running.

706
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,901
I have this under control, Liz.

707
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,738
I have it figured out. It's all up here.

708
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,990
-Okay?
-I can't do this anymore, Ted.

709
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,200
What are--
What are you talking about, Liz?

Liz, look at me. Liz! Liz, look at me.

711
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,955
Do you not love me anymore?

712
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,001
No, I do.

What if I get out?

716
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,053
I can get out of here. I know I can.

717
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,305
And we could go away. 
We can go away to Canada.

718
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,432
We can do whatever we wanna do.

719
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,685
I promise, it would be--
We'd be free. It would be fine.

I'm Detective Mike Fisher.

Well, it's all over the news.

I can't stress enough how important it is

783
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,501
that you notify me if he contacts you.

if you do know something
that you're not telling me,

you would be guilty
of aiding and abetting.

You came all the way from Colorado
to tell me that?

787
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,680
I thought that

788

just how serious this is.

what they've managed to do.

958
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,743
They're using me as a ploy

959
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,037
for the Sheriff to win points
in the next election.

960
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,747
I'm being used for political gain.

961
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,874
-My God. Of course.
-Think about it.

962
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,669
He's been spinning his wheels
on this sorority case

963
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,047
and the biggest fish in America
lands right in his little pond.

964
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,091
Who do you think he's gonna pin it on?

965
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,719
I literally just autographed
my own "wanted" poster.

966
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,138
I'm more popular than Disney World.

967
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,515
[Ted chuckles]

968
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,688
It would...

969
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,481
probably feel good to...

970
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,694
have a familiar face around.

971
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,739
What, you wanna move to Florida?

972
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,158
Why not?

973
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,245
There are worse places to be.

974
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,296
It's great to see you.

975
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:25,883
[guard] No touching!

976
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,022
[knocking at door] 

977
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,242
Hey.

978
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,205
Brought you some chicken soup.

979
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,248
Thank you.

980
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,544
I mean, you haven't been at work all week,
so I figured you were sick.

981
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,424
All right.

982
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,301
All right. Feel better.

983
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,266
Do you wanna come in?

984
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,478
Yeah!

985
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,648
Molly will be home from school soon.

986
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,320
Sorry, it's... a mess.

987
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,781
It's okay. Cleaner than my place.

988
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,823
[both chuckle]

989
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,666
Thank you. 

990
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,710
Ted!

991
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,088
I'm Dan Dowd. I'll be your lead counsel.

992
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,508
I've got a great team of public defenders
waiting in a private room.

993
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,761
We're gonna get you
the best defense taxes can buy.

994
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,515
Should we go meet them
so we can discuss this in private?

995
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,227
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of Carole Ann.

996
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,813
Yeah. Go ahead, have a seat.

997
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,818
Hi, Carole Ann. Dan Dowd.

998
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,821
Is it true?

999
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,615
They're putting
news cameras in the courtroom?

1000
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,868
You'll be the first
nationally televised trial in history.

1001
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,996
If you make it to trial, that is.

1002
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,623
The State is offering a deal, Ted.

1003
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,917
If you plead guilty
to the murder charges,

1004
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,503
they've agreed to recommend life sentences

1005
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,088
instead of the death penalty.

1006
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,841
That's a joke, right?

1007
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,970
We should really go and discuss this
with the rest of the team, Ted.

1008
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,097
If you think there's a chance in hell

1009
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,932
I'll plead guilty to these charges,

1010
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,726
you're out of your fucking mind!

1011
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,148
Let's discuss this another time, okay?

1012
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,274
Okay.

1013
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,652
Great to meet you, Carole Ann.

1014
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,157
[door buzzes] 

1015
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,369
My own lawyers are against me.

1016
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:00,912
This is a nightmare.

1017
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,498
So sorry, Ted.

1018
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,836
Tell me what I can do to help.

1019
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:13,175
You know, maybe I could 
set the facts straight on the outside

1020
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,802
and make sure 
your side of the story is heard.

1021
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,430
That would help a lot.

1022
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,724
I'm under a gag order.

1023
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,976
I can't say anything.

1024
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,313
You'd be willing to do that for me?

1025
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,607
Of course.

1026
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,693
Ted, I'm staying in Florida.

1027
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,907
I would never ask you
to do anything like this. I--

1028
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,659
[guard] No touching.

1029
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,705
You're not asking. I'm insisting.

1030
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,749
Ted, you need me.

1031
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,795
It wasn't an accident I saw you in Utah.

1032
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,588
I don't have friends in Utah.

1033
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,049
I was there for you.

1034
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,886
When I saw you were engaged,

1035
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,679
I got cold feet.

1036
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,141
This trial could get ugly.

1037
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,355
I don't know, but, I mean,
 you can hear some really awful things.

1038
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,441
Can't be any worse than what
they're already saying on TV.

1039
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,693
What do they know?

1040
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,488
Not the truth.

1041
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,532
-[reporters clamoring] 
-[man] <i>Mr. Simpson!</i>

1042
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,034
-Do you have any comments on the trial?
-Let me say this...

1043
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,161
This man is a threat to society,

1044
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,413
he's made a mockery of our justice system.

1045
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,666
That may have worked
on the other side of the Rockies,

1046
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,293
but as lead prosecutor
for the great state of Florida

1047
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,839
I have every intention of showing him how
we do things in the Sunshine State.

this case...

1080
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,146
is so much more than a double murder.

1081
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,857
[whispering]
Don't let his opening statement faze you.

1082
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,734
-Show no emotion at all.
-[Simpson] This case...

1083
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,362
is about catching a monster.

1084
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:26,284
In the early morning hours
of January 15th, 1978,

1085
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,830
a young woman arrived home 
to the Chi Omega sorority house.

1086
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,208
She heard a thump upstairs.

1087
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,629
A man ran down carrying an oak log

1088
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,047
and fled.

1089
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,758
The young woman went upstairs
to investigate

1090
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:46,137
where her sorority sister stumbled out 
of her bedroom spitting up blood

1091
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,473
because her face had been smashed.

1092
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,685
Her roommate's too.

1093
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,479
She was sitting on her bed in a daze.

1094
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,233
They were the lucky ones.

1095
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,861
In the room next over,

1096
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,365
another young woman
was lying face down in her own blood.

1097
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,285
<i>Her neck had been twisted</i>
<i>at an inhuman angle.</i>

1098
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,954
<i>The jaw was broken.</i>

1099
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,207
<i>She was missing a nipple.</i>

1100
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,377
Her body had bite marks on it.

1101
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,546
She'd been raped...

1102
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,256
and strangled.

1103
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:24,384
Strangled with a pantyhose garrote,

1104
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,221
so tight that her neck
was constricted to half its size.

1105
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,223
[crowd mumbling]

1106
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,517
This next girl...

1107
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,772
we're still not sure if she died
from strangulation

1108
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,818
or the blow to her head that left 
a baseball-sized hole in her skull.

1109
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,408
We do know that her underwear was torn
off with such force,

1110
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,493
it left burn marks on her thigh.

1111
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,456

When we questioned him about the crimes,

he declined to have an attorney present.

And no notes be taken.

1153
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,054
So this was off the record?

1154
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:34,180
He thought so.

should automatically disqualify
anything masquerading as evidence,

"stealthy," "clandestine,"

"sneaky," "sly," "furtive," "concealed,"

No true evidence

combined with pre-trial publicity,

1244

it's highly likely
they can secure convictions.

And because of the nature of the offenses,

several death sentences.

1266
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,653
Don't be angry, Teddy.

1267
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,280
We were just trying to help you.

1268
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,157
What the hell are you thinking?

1269
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,868
Bringing my mom into this?

1270
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,329
Don't ever do that again.

1271
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:51,831
Ever.

1272
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,750
I was just trying to help.

1273
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,877
I'm sorry. I'm...

1274
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:57,670
I love you.

1275
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,631
I just don't want them to take your life.

1276
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,092
I don't trust this jury.

1277
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,135
I'm scared.

1278
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,095
I'm really scared, Ted.

1279
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,148
[whispering]
It's the right thing to do, Ted.

1280
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,536
I understand there is a matter

1281
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,622
you would like to
present to the court?

1282
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:42,965
Your Honor...

1283
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,678
never have I encountered a man...

1284
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,931
so dedicated

1285
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,392
and brazen...

1286
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,314
in coercing his own client
into admitting guilt.

1287
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,818
It makes me wonder if he has the stamina

1288
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,820
or basic mental acuity

1289
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,322
to roll up his sleeves
and do the hard work.

1290
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,952
I will not accept
my so-called attorney's advice

1291
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,329
that I plead guilty to save my own life.

1292
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,748
I am, in fact, not guilty.

1293
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,750
And I demand the discharge

1294
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,753
of my roundly inept counsel,
as is my right

1295
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,338
under <i>Faretta v. California.</i>

1296
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,464
Your Honor,

1297
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,132
I would like to resign as counsel.

1298
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,009
Counselor's first words I can agree to.

1299
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,846
-Fuck you!
-Counselors, muzzle yourselves.

1300
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,347
I'll consider the motion granted.

1301
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,474
How's this for motion?

You can see the double bite...

1317
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:18,227

the defendant's

1319
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,274
Doctor, can you offer an opinion,

1320
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:26,068
within a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty,

1321
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:29,822
whether or not those teeth
represented in that photograph

1322
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:33,367
made the bite marks
on the buttocks of Lisa Levy?

1323
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,994
Yes, sir. I can.

1324
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,913
The defendants teeth

1325
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:38,748
made those marks.

1326
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,625
[Simpson] No further questions.

1327
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,585
I, uh, pass the witness.

1328
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,837
Doctor, you may return to the witness box.

1329
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:51,886
[Ted] Doctor Souviron,

1330
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,346
is there any way to test

1331
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,183
whether those teeth will make
the same marks over and over?

1332
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,392
Yes.

1333
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,937
I took models of the defendant's teeth

1334
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,104
and I went to the morgue.

1335
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,689
And I pressed those models

1336
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,108
into the buttocks area
of different individuals...

1337
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,194
and yes, they do match.

1338
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,403
[Ted] I'm sorry, Dr. Souviron,

1339
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,323
you did this experiment on cadavers?

1340
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,034
Well, I couldn't find any live volunteers.

1341
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,037
I have to question the competency
of this expert witness.

1342
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,915
Your Honor, I question the competency
of this entire trial.

1343
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,124
This is a farce.

1344
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,087
Dr. Souviron, on that
we could not agree more.

that you are not on spring break.

It is a capital murder case.

The court has already ruled
on this witness' expertise, counselor.

01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,575
And you are skating on thin ice.

Yes. Yes, I did.

And to the best of your memory,

1424

did I have any sort of chip
in my front tooth at that time?

01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:17,294
No. No, you most definitely did not.

1426
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:18,295
[Ted] Your Honor...

1427
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,298
I think you see what I'm getting at here.

1428
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,886
I would like to subpoena all newspapers
to turn over their negatives of me.

1429
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:31,016
If the chip did not occur
until March, 1978,

1430
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,519
two months after the Chi Omega crimes

1431
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,771
and the state's odontologists
say otherwise,

1432
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,358
the state's odontologists have obviously
taken my teeth

1433
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,194
and twisted them 
every which way but loose

1434
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,279
to fit.

1435
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,284
Son, you can jump up and down 
and hang from the chandelier,

1436
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:52,538
but the court will not dash out 
for new evidence at your command.

1437
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,376
Is there no work ethic
left here in Florida?

1438
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,961
You impress me not, sir.

1439
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,671
The feeling is mutual, Your Honor.

1440
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,589
I'm sure it is. Bless your heart.

1441
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,758
And unless there is anything else,

1442
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,468
Miss Boone may be excused.

1443
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,179
No, there is one-- Just one more thing.

1444
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:10,723
Your Honor...

1445
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:18,355
Will you marry me?

1446
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,816
[crowd murmuring]

1447
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:22,276
Your Honor...

1448
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,320
Yes. [giggles] 

1449
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,033
Then I do hereby...

1450
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:30,826
marry you.

1451
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,494
Are you shitting me? Objection!

1452
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,495
[Ted] Your Honor...

1453
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,748
a public declaration properly phrased,

1454
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,958
in an open courtroom,
in the presence of court officers

1455
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:40,377
constitutes a lawful marriage
here in Florida.

1456
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,755
Indeed it does.

1457
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,511
[gavel bangs] 

1458
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:53,140

<i>Bundy's marriage proposal as a charade--</i>

1459
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,603
Was it him who called the other day?

1460
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,609
I know you unplug the phones
when I fall asleep.

1461
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,111
What did he say?

1462
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,822
-It doesn't matter.
-What did he say?

1463
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,492
He froze.

1464
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,703
He froze because he knew
that I knew what he was.

1465
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,289
They're going to send him
to the chair, Liz.

1466
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,333
And that seems
like an easier out than this torture

1467
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,086
you're putting yourself through
because you won't let him go.

1468
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,338
He's killing you
because you're letting him.

1469
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:28,842
You're just jealous because Ted and I
have a bond you and I never could.

1470

You're just trying to hurt me.

It's okay.

1477
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,154
I wish I could take it all back.

01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:55,077
Take what back?

1481
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:59,206
Why do you act like you're responsible
for the things that happened to him?

1482
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,383
I'm the one
who gave his name to the police.

1483
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:13,720
[reporter] <i>He was described </i>

Back when those girls disappeared
from Lake Sammamish

1488
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,317
I saw the sketch.

1489
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,446
It's a minor resemblance,
but it's very, very minor and--

1490
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,072
[man] <i>What kind of car does he drive?</i>

1491
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,032
It's a 1968 Volkswagen Bug.

1492
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,742
But it's kind of a light beige--

1493
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,119
<i>Let me stop you right there.</i>

1494
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,455
<i>It's the right car,</i>

<i>I can put his name down</i>

1497
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,295
<i>-What is his name?</i>
-Um...

1498
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,339
Ted.

1499
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,009
Ted Bundy.

1500
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,677
I could be the reason that he's there.

1501
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,262
Because everyone's assuming

1502
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,598
that all these other murders
were done by Ted

1503
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:00,142
and all I did
was call his name in to Seattle,

1504
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,312
because of a sketch
that looked kind of like him.

1505
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,063
You were the one that told them.

1506
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,649
You shouldn't be ashamed of that.

1507
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,443
If you told them that--

1508
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,487
He... he deserves it, Liz.

1509
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,197
Liz, you did the right thing.

1510
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,368
You just gotta let him go.

1511
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,290
Mr. Simpson, your closing argument.

1512
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,925
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1513
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:37,804
you have been witness
to the unspeakable horrors

1514
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,390
of the defendant's heinous crimes.

1515
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,518
You've seen...

1516
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,894
ghastly injuries,

1517
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,897
smashed in faces, broken jaws...

1518
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,403
The bite-mark carnage of a predator.

1519
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:55,697
[Ted] Ladies and gentlemen...

1520
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:57,824
there are two ways

1521
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,452
for police to investigate crimes.

1522
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,080
They can go to a crime scene...

1523
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,707
<i>search for clues</i>

1524
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:09,670
<i>and follow those clues</i>
<i>to a logical conclusion...</i>

1525
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,339
We have provided forensic expert testimony

1526
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,967
<i>to corroborate every last bit of evidence.</i>

1527
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:17,636
...or they can begin with a suspect,

1528
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,014
decide on that suspect,

1529
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:24,101
and then somehow
make all of the evidence fit

1530
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,311
only that suspect.

1531
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,897
You've seen
the bottle of hair mist he used

1532
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,899
to sexually penetrate 
one of the victims,

1533
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:34,486
in a manner so savage
it ruptured her internal organs.

1534
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,907
It is clearly a charade
to cast an innocent man

1535
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:42,327
as some sort of monster in a horror film. 

1536
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,580
We have placed the defendant
at the scene of the crime...

1537
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,290
Their own witness testified

1538
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:49,418
that the man wore a mask,
obscuring half of his face.

1539
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:53,297
You've seen the oak log he used
to bludgeon these poor victims.

1540
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:54,840
The lighting was low.

1541
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,427
The State of Florida has proved beyond
all reasonable doubt

1542
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,263
that the defendant
Theodore Robert Bundy

1543
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,683
is guilty of two murders
in the first-degree

1544
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,643
and three attempted murders.

1545
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,854
Ladies and gentlemen, I am...

1546
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,732
that innocent suspect.

1547
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:18,113
Ted, Ted, is this really just a case
of wrong place, wrong time?

1548
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,532
You know, police,
they just wanna solve crimes.

1549
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,826
And sometimes they don't think things
all the way through.

1550
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,621
They are willing to take 
the convenient alternative.

1551
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:28,206
And in this case,
the convenient alternative was me.

1552
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,875
[deputy] Ted, we have a verdict.

1553
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,710
They've come to verdict.

1554
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,004
Oh, my gosh. Seven hours.

1555
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,881
Well...

1556
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,799

-[Ted chuckling]
-Ted.

1558
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,805
You know that future you saw for us?

1559
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,266
The one with the house
and the dog and the car?

1560
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:48,977
Well, yeah. Yeah.

1561
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:50,479
Well...

1562
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,607
now there's going to be another part
to that future.

1563
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:57,861
Ted...

1564
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,154
it's time to go.

1565
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:01,490
Ted.

1566
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,700
Yeah... yeah, I--

1567
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:05,661
I'll-- One... just one moment. Um...

1568
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,295
Let's go finish this thing.

1569
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:27,140
I am in receipt
of the jury's verdict, Bailiff.

1570
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:32,187
Would you deliver this to the clerk
for pronouncement?

1571
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,525
Will the defendant rise?

1572

[Louise]<i> I consider the death penalty</i>

1587

01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,576
barbaric things

one human can impose on another.

1591
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,626
My Christian upbringing tells me that

1592
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,462
to take another's life

1593
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:42,215
under any circumstance is wrong.

1594
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,637
And I don't believe that the State of
Florida is above the laws of God.

1595
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:49,848
Thank you, ma'am.

1596
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:52,476
<i>Bless you.</i>

1597
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,147
<i>While I certainly agree it is...</i>

1598
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,442
<i>always a tragedy</i>

1599
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:04,863
<i>when any life is taken</i>
<i>against one's will...</i>

1600
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,703
it is this court's reasoned judgement

1601
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:16,291
you be adjudicated guilty
of murder in the first degree...

1602
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,003
that the killings were indeed

1603
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:24,090
atrocious and cruel in that they were 

1604
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,092
extremely wicked,

1605
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,678
shockingly evil,

1606
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:30,847
vile...

1607
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,351
and with utter indifference to human life

1608
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:38,772
and that you shall be put to death
by current of electricity

1609
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,857
that shall pass through your body

1610
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,275
until you are dead.

1611
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,029
I understand you have
a statement you'd like to make,

1612
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:47,697
and you may do so now.

1613
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,117
I won't ask for mercy.

1614
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:54,663
In fact...

1615
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:58,208
I find it absurd

1616
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,503
to ask for mercy
for something that I did not do.

1617
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,635
I'm not the one responsible for these...

1618
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:10,929
horrific acts.

1619
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,978
Although the verdict found in part...

1620
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:22,274
that these crimes had been committed...

1621
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,735
it erred...

1622
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:29,114
in finding who committed them.

1623
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,202
As a consequence...

1624
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,039
I do not accept the sentence

1625
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,794
because it is not a sentence of me.

1626
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:48,174
It is a sentence of someone else

1627
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,927
who is not standing here today.

1628
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:57,767
The court is going to sentence the person
found guilty of the offense.

1629
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,312
Your name, sir, was on that verdict.

1630
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,148
Take care of yourself, young man.

1631
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,775
I say that to you, sincerely.

1632
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,777
Take care of yourself.

1633
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:10,697
You're a bright young man.

1634
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,533
You'd have made a good lawyer.

1635
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:16,244
I would've loved to have you practice
in front of me.

1636
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:17,746
But...

1637
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:20,540
you went to a different way, partner.

1638
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,711
It is been a tragedy for this court

1639
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:31,092
to see the total waste of humanity
that we have experienced here.

1640
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,889
I don't have any animosity toward you.

1641
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:38,016
I want you to know that.

1642
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,519
Take care of yourself.

[Liz] So I know you're new here,

1646
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,602
but your numbers are incredibly high

1647
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:24,980
and you are doing
an outstanding job so far.

1648
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,815
This is a really
wonderful place for women.

1649
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,150
Liz, I thought you'd like to see this.

1650
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,318
Thanks, Janet.

1651
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,993
Would you, uh... 
would you give me a moment, please?

1652
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,035
Of course.

My love for you was never a lie.

1672

I fell in love with you

I need to hear the truth from you now.

Come on, you know
that I'm not capable of these crimes.

I would never hurt a woman.

1676

Have I ever laid a hand on you?
Have I ever raised my voice?

1677
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,584
I'm the one who gave your name 
to the police.

What?

1679
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,884
It was 1974,

1680
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:03,721
when they put that sketch in the paper
of the man at Lake Sammamish,

1681
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:08,601
who used a fake cast to lure two young
women into his Volkswagen Bug.

1682
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:11,020
Is he ever gonna find out
that it was me who called?

[man] <i>No, ma'am. He won't find out.</i>

<i>Now, what is your name?</i>

1685
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:17,485
I used to think that I ruined your life

1686
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,988
because my call to King County 
made you the suspect

1687
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,489
in all these other cases.

1688
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,284
For years I've carried this guilt

1689
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,744
that I'm to blame for everything.

1690
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,747
Why would you blame yourself?

1691
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,667
Because I could have helped
save some of these girls

1692
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,669
if only I hadn't trusted you.

1693
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:37,714
I can't live like this anymore, Ted.

1694
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,507
It's not my guilt.

1695
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:41,301
It's yours.

1696
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:46,764
Did you do these things, Ted?

1697
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,476
Of course not.

1698
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,979
There are detectives
from seven states out there

1699
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:56,858
lined up with arms of open case files
expecting confessions.

1700
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,443
I didn't do anything, Liz.

1701
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,486
Then why are you going to tell them
that you did?

1702
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,448
That's what you're doing, right?

1703
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,366
Trading the truth to buy more time?

1704
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,368
I have to tell them what they wanna hear.

1705
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,704
They will fry me any day now.

1706
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,081
It's the only way to save my own life.

1707
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,543
So, yes, I'm feeding them information,
little bits of bullshit,

1708
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,170
but none of it is true.

1709
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,130
This is all gonna end.

1710
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:22,217
It's only gonna end with the truth.

1711
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,803
Did you do it?

1712
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:28,306
No.

1713
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,602
Denise Naslund and Janice Ott, the two
young women from Lake Sammamish?

1714
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:33,811
No.

1715
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:36,940
The young woman from Utah
who couldn't even look at you in court?

1716
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:37,857
No.

1717
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:39,609
The Colorado women?

1718
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:41,694
Oh, Liz.

1719
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,447
You've always been so insatiable.

1720
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,242
And it's clear you've come here
with an agenda. And I'm sorry...

1721
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:50,078
I can't give you what you want.

1722
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,997
The Chi Omega college girls from Florida?

1723
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:55,208
Absolutely not.

1724
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:57,877
One of your victims was a child, Ted.

1725
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,129
Kimberly Leach.

1726
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:01,965
She was 12.

1727
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:05,885
Twelve! And I let you be alone with Molly!

1728
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,304
I did not do these things, Liz!

1729
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,392
Did you ever wanna do them to me?

1730
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:14,143
[sighs]

1731
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,439
I wish that we could be alone.

1732
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,066
We could really talk.

1733
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,402
I can't tell you anything right now.

1734
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,070
Liz, there's people listening.

1735
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,989
Are you telling me that you're sick, Ted?

1736
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,198
Back off!

1737
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,158
I told you the truth,

1738
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,828
and now you need to do the same for me.

1739

I've been suffocating!

1740

All these years,
I've had your hands around my neck.

Release me!

Not you, Liz.

What happened to her head?

If she was deposited in the woods...

1747
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:35,767
then animals could've conceivably
done something like--

1748
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,894
Animals don't do that!

1749

I'm not a bad guy.

1750
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:51,032
You need to release me, Ted!

You all right?

I am.

I'm proud of you, Mom.

Does that include the time I stole
a comic book when I was 5 years-old?

I'm not guilty of the charges

Step out, Mr. Bundy.

Oh, it's an indictment. All right.

-Mr. Bundy--
-You told them that you were gonna get me.

He said he was gonna get me.
Okay, you got the indictment.

It's all you're going to get.

01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:15,648
I don't think that Ted belongs in jail.

1789

The things in Florida don't concern me

1799

<i>Bundy appeared to find this humorous.</i>

1800
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:49,098
Um... he just seemed like a normal...

1801

a normal person that

1802

[reporter 4]<i> The most important evidence</i>

1805

And the bite mark, that was the most
damaging evidence.

1806
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:09,368
We're very satisfied with what

that one human being 
can impose upon another.
