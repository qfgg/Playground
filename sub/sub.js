00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,440
我没必要给你回短信 我们之间什么都算不上
I don't have to text you back. We're not like a thing.

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,180
好吧 我只是…

Does this look infected to you?

54
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,200
谁喝了我的酒
Someone drank my booze.

55
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,240

Nobody.

姐妹之间不应该有秘密
Sisters don't keep secrets.

62
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,950
真的没有
Seriously, it was nobody.

63
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,990
那好吧 但愿你那个“没谁”戴了套
Well, I hope nobody used a condom.

64
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,400
我可不想我们里面出个荡妇
We don't want somebody looking like a whore.

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,880
谢了 丹妮尔 多谢关心
Thanks, Danielle. Super helpful.

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,080

What are sisters for?

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,190
对了 别忘了宿舍午餐会

She finally rolls in.

70
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,590
我昨天晚上是不是又出糗了
Did I totally embarrass myself last night?

71
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,190
没有的事儿
Not at all.

72
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,070
也就是
Unless you consider

73
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,590
在桌子上狂歌乱舞 打了两场架
dancing on a table, starting two fights,

74
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,100
把椒盐脆饼块吐的到处都是
and barfing pretzel chunks all over the bar embarrassing.

75
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,660
快告诉我这不是真的
Please, tell me you're kidding.

76
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,750
还有 你昨天还和尼克西姆斯上演了一场法式深吻真人秀
Oh, and you also rammed your tongue down Nick Sims' throat

77
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,270
就当着丹妮尔的面
right in front of Danielle.

78
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,200
天啊 不过她刚才还关心我来着
Oh, God, but she was so nice to me this morning.

79
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,130
是啊 估计她昨天也喝高了
Yeah, I think she was as drunk as you last night.

80
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,940
就当是集体失忆吧
So, consider it collective amnesia.

81
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,420
老天保佑
Thank God for that.

82
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,200
我的天 糟糕
Oh, crap.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,650
上课要迟到了
I'm so late for class.

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,820
我的书呢
Can't find my damn book!

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,230
别以为你不说我就不知道
Did you really think you could keep it a secret from me?

86
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,660
你是怎么发现的
How did you find out?

87
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,860
驾照上有出生日期
Driver's license.

88
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,460
另外 那张证件照真不咋地
Not the best picture, I might add.

89
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,330
我的手机铃声也是你改的吧
I assume you changed my ringer too.

90
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,430
我吗
Who me?

91
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,630
绝对不是我
Never.

92
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,500
许的什么愿
What'd you wish for?

93
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,770
换个室友
A new roommate.

94
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,170
天真

95
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,180
我好不容易才学会做的
I made that from scratch!

96
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,900
对不起啦 蛋糕热量太高了
Sorry, too many carbs.

97
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300

对这种物质的活性响应水平检测表明

存在量子平面的加速现象

100
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,680
这导致了部分显正价β碳离子

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,580
和显负价羟基对之间

102
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,260

109
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,120
我们不能再举办

也没什么
Nothing.

117
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,420
也就是你把一份猫女郎自助餐摆在我们桌子上了
Except for that cat lady buffet you just dumped at our table.

118
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,060
我没看错吧 那是巧克力牛奶吗
And is that chocolate milk I see?

119
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,560
我还没吃早餐呢

120
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,340
世界上有早餐这种东西存在吗 贝基

等等 你们俩认识吗
Wait, you two know each other?

124
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,500
- 是的 – 不认识
- Yeah. - No!

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,360
我们俩 去年修过同一门课
We had uh, a class together last year.

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,890
我是来把这个还给你的

我知道这不关我的事
It's none of my business, but...

146
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,710
但是我觉得你这么做
I think something like this is

147
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,830
会惹出大麻烦来的
bound to have some pretty serious consequences.

148
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,690
你说得没错 这不关你的事
You're right. It is none of your business.

149
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,060
塞尔丁医生 马尔科医生 请到2476病房
Dr. Cerdin, Dr. Marco in 2476

150
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,020
塞尔丁医生 马尔科医生 请到2476病房
Dr. Cerdin, Dr. Marco in 2476

151
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,490
今天不行
I can't do this today.

152
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,280
医院里事情太多
There's too much going on in the building.

153
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,870
我还有病人
I have patients.

154
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,960
我控制不住自己
And I'm losing mine.

155
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,360
格雷戈里
Gregory?

156
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,340
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, sweetie.

157
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,030
门怎么了
What's with the door?

158
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,790
什么地方卡住了吧
Uh, stupid thing got jammed.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,120
我这儿也刚好完事
Oh, just wrapping up here.

160
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,600
你见过我的学生特蕾莎吧
Have you met my student, Teresa?

161
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,960
不 我没见过
No, I haven't.

162
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,300
你好 幸会
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

163
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,580
多谢帮忙
Thank you so much for helping me out.

164
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,510
你来真是个惊喜
This is a nice surprise.

165
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,370
自从上次我们大吵了一架之后 内森就好像变了一个人
Nathan's been acting really strange since our big fight.

166
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,390
今天早上 他开车去亚特兰大
And this morning, he drove to Atlanta for a last-minute

167
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
说是去参加一个新健身馆的紧急会议
business meeting about opening a new gym.

168
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
进来
Enter.

169
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,370
这里面有点古怪 之前从没听他提起过这个项目
It's weird because I've never heard anything about it before.

170
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,520
我试着让自己不把这件事太当回事儿
But I'm trying not to let that bring me down.

171
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,540
- 你穿的是我的上衣吗 - 我穿着好看吗
- Is that my top? - How cute is it on me?

172
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,500
无所谓啦 拜托别把它弄脏就行
Whatever. Just don't get anything on it, please.

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,590
你是说 小心别让尼克把“奶油”弄到上面 是吗
You mean like Nick's nutter butter?

174
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,580
哇 厉害了我的姐
Wow. Classy, Danielle.

175
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,880
你晚上几点来聚会
What time are you going to the party tonight?

176
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,510
不知道 一会儿吧
I dunno, later.

177
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,890
我呸 我们的学费算是白交了
Ugh. Our tuition dollars at work.

178
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,080
反正
Anyhoo...

179
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,960
别太晚了 不然X∑K兄弟会的小鲜肉们就被抢光了
Don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

180
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,180
-知道了 拜 -拜
- 'kay. Byeee. - Byeee.

181
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,870
谁拿了我的吹风机
Who took my hair dryer?

182
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,260
疯婆子
Crazy bitch.

183
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,040
特蕾莎 是我 爸爸
Teresa, it's Dad.

184
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,920
我在餐厅等了你一个多小时
I sat in that restaurant waiting for you for over an hour.

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,020
你怎么能这样对我呢
I can't believe you would do this to me.

186
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,220
偏偏是今天
Today, of all days!

187
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,090
贝菲尔德必胜 贝菲尔德宝贝必胜
Bayfield, baby!

188
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,180
快点儿 别晚了
Can't miss tonight!

189
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,650
好啦 你们这些家伙真会玩
Okay, you guys are hilarious!

190
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,000
别躲着啦
You can come out now!

191
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,090
胆小鬼
Losers.

192
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,440
喂 你的朋友往那边去了
Yo, I think your friends went the other way.

193
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,200
有什么问题吗
Can I help you?

194
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,160
听着 怪人 我才不怕你呢
Look, weirdo, I'm not scared.

195
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
你怎么不拿这套把戏去吓唬吓唬
Why don't you go try this with

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
三八协会的那些小婊砸去
one of the heffers at Delta Gamma?

197
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,850
她们就喜欢角色扮演
They're into cosplay.

198
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,240
我要叫警察啦
Okay, I'm calling the cops!

199
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,510
闭嘴
Shut up!

200
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,810
嘿 你醒啦
Oh, hey, you're up.

201
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
我不太确定你要不要睡在这儿 就
I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in or not, so.

202
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,920
哦…对
Oh... right.

203
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,840
我昨晚把你的裤子叠好了放在这儿了
I folded your pants for you last night

204
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,970
我不确定它会不会起皱
I wasn't sure if the material gets wrinkled.

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,010
呃…
Uh...

206
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,250
你可能都不记得我叫什么了吧
I don't know if you remember my name or not

207
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,000
你昨晚上真是喝大了
You know you were pretty wasted last night.

208
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,770
不过
But uh...

209
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,640

- I'm... - Carter.

210
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,600
你记得啊
You remembered.

211
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,450
嗯 泰诺
Ugh. Tylenol?

212
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,550
你说什么
What?

213
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,840
我头疼得厉害 你这儿有没有泰诺
Uh, my head is killing me. Do you have any Tylenol?

214
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,800
哦 有的
Oh, uh, yes.

215
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,570
呃
Um...

216
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,510

It's over there.

217
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,170
对
Right.

218
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,330
在你衣服底下
It's underneath your clothes...

219
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,850
- 就在… - 对对

Thanks.

221
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,450
水
And...

222
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,570
好像你以前来过一样
It's like you've been here before.

223
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,600
你还好吧
Are you okay?

224
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,150
小树
Tree?

225

Are you okay?

226
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,710
哥们儿 你有没有把那个大美妞办了
Dude, did you hit that fine vagine or what?

227
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,550
哦
Oh.

228
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,690

I'm sorry.

247
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,830
我给你发的短信你一条都没回
You haven't returned any of my texts.

248
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,860

I gotta go.

254
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,380
打给我
Call me?

255
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

256
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,890
你这个小婊砸鬼鬼祟祟地
You sneaky little biotch.

257
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,420
说 他是谁
Who was it?

258
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,900
好姐妹之间不应该有秘密
Sisters don't keep secrets.

259
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,650
我有一种现在这一切都经历过的错觉
I'm totally having déjà vu right now.

260
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,190
哦 我每时每刻都有这样的错觉
Oh, I have it all the time.

261
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,150
这就好像
It's supposed to mean like

262
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,120
某人一边想着你一边打飞机一样
someone's thinking about you while they're masturbating.

263
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,670
我一天里至少有五次这种感觉
I have it at least five times a day.

264
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,580
我没开玩笑 我现在整天都有这样的感觉 太诡异了
Seriously, I've been having it all day. It's so weird.

265
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,140
下次也许你要多喝点水了 宝贝儿
Maybe you should switch to water next time, hun.

266
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,200
我…好的 谢了 我会记得的
I...yeah, thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

267
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,790
谁让咱们是好姐妹呢
What are sisters for?

268
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,370
对了 别忘了宿舍午餐会
Oh, uh, and don't forget. House meeting at lunch.

269
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,880
你不会是真不记得了吧
Hello?

270
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,280
上星期四就通知了 小树
It's been on the board since last Thursday, Tree.

271
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,720
对…我记得 我…
Yeah... I remember. I...

272
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,240
某人总算是回来了
She finally rolls in.

273
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,100
太匪夷所思了
That's so weird.

274
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
你没事吧
You okay?

275
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,350
你昨晚的洋相出得可是够大的
You were kind of a mess last night.

276
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,640
该死 上课要晚了
Oh, shhit. I'm so late for class.

277
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,490
别以为你不说我就不知道
Did you really think you'd keep it a secret from me?

278
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,730
不想知道我是怎么发现的吗
Don't you wanna know how I found out?

279
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,930
你看我驾照了
Driver's license?

280
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,130
真聪明
Clever girl.

281
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,990
至于你的证件照嘛
That picture, though.

282
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,520
我得走了
I gotta go.

283
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,290
可你还没吹蜡…
But, you didn't even blow out the c...

284
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,820
蜡烛呢
Candle.

285
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,850
我们真的是要抓紧了
We really need to step up our game.

286
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,980
此外 我们还要决定今年的慈善项目遴选
And we still need to pick this year's charity.

287
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,230
就目前而言
I can say right now,

288
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,730
我们不能
There's no way we're doing

289
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,180
再举办面向残障人士的艺展活动了
the special needs art fair again.

290
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,350
大赛在即 弘扬校风
Get your school spirit on before the big game.

291
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,800
学生证9折
10% off with your student ID.

292
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,840
你怎么了 小树
What's wrong, Tree?

293
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,930
我想我只是有点儿累
Um... I'm just a little tired, I guess.

294
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,300
胡扯
No, dumbass.

295
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,310
那又是怎么回事
What's wrong with that?

296
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,110
也不像你的范儿了
So not Kappa cuisine.

297
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,180
我没看错吧 那是巧克力奶吗
And is that chocolate milk I see?

298
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,890
我还没吃早餐呢
I missed breakfast.

299
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,560
我们都没吃早餐呢 贝基
We all missed breakfast, Becky.

300
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,170
贝基 当心
Becky, look out!

301
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,530
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

302
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,710
对不起 小树
I'm sorry, Tree.

303
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,640
等等 你们是不是认识
Wait, you two know each other?

304
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,490
- 是的 – 不认识
- Yeah. - No!

305
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,530
我是说 我们俩去年修过同一门课
I mean, we had a class together last year.

306
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,730
就这些
That's all.

307
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,180
对不起啦
I'm sorry about all this.

308
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,350
等等
Hey!

309
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,230
什么
What?

310
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,400
我的手链呢
My bracelet.

311
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,630
对
Oh.

312
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,410
真的抱歉给你添麻烦了
You know, I'm sorry again about the mess.

313
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,140
真够人渣的
What a douchebag.

314
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,640
今天不行
I can't do this today.

315
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,840
医院里事情太多
There's too much going on in the building.

316
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,900
我有话要跟你说
I need to talk to you.

317
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,850
小树 我…
Tree, I...

318
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,050
我知道你想说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

319
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,250
你知道
You do?

320
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,760
听着…
Look...

321
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,290
你这样的年轻女孩喜欢上一个老男人
It's normal for a young girl

322
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,280
也不算是什么稀奇事儿
to have feelings for an older man.

323
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,160
但你不能让自己陷得太深
But you can't fall in love.

324
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
我并没有爱上你
I'm not falling in love with you.

325
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,870
没有吗
You're not?

326
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,870
我这一整天都过得诡异至极
No. I've been having the weirdest day...

327
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,490
你老婆
Your wife.

328
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,050
这可是有点煞风景
Uh, that's kind of a buzz kill.

329
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,160
格雷戈里 你在里面吗
Gregory, are you in there?

330
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,860
谢天谢地 你把门锁上了
Thank God you locked the door.

331
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,940
嗨 亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

332
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,120
我没注意我什么时候把门锁上了 呃…
Ah, I didn't realize I'd locked the door, um...

333
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,040
我这儿也刚好完事了
Uh, just wrapping up here.

334
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,340
你见过我的学生特蕾莎吧
Have you met my student, Teresa?

335
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,640
没有
No.

336
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,420
我没见过
I haven't.

337
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,610
幸会
Nice to meet you.

341
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,020
太棒了
There you go.

342
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,090
- 我们跟这个蛋糕一样甜蜜 - 等等 这儿好像有一只小虫子
- That was us. - Wait, I think I found a bug.

343
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,040
- 就在这 - 仔细看
- Right there. - Take a look.

344
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,230
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

345
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,360
妈妈要出大招了
Mom goes in for the kill!

346
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,740
不 别这样
No! Oh, no!

347
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,680
不许看
Don't look at me.

348
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,210
好吧 看来我是没的吃了…
Well, I guess I'm not having...

349
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,350
…一个新健身会馆的会议
...business meeting about opening a new gym.

350
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,870
好啦 我就借穿这一个晚上
I know. I'm just borrowing it for tonight.

351
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,150
你晚上几点来聚会
What time are you going to the party?

352
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,710
我试着让自己不要把这件事太当回事儿
But I'm trying not to let that bring me down.

353
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,910
你在听吗
Hello?

354
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,560
走神婊
Earth to space bitch.

355
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,820
你说什么
What?

356
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,840
我问你啥时来轰趴呀
What time are you going to the pah-ty?

357
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,340
不知道 一会儿吧
Uh pff, I don't know... later.

358
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,430
咱们的学费算是白交了
Ugh, our tuition dollars at work.

359
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,850
好吧 喔
Okay, whoa.

360
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,250

Chill out. It's just another rolling blackout, sweetie.

361
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,980

It happened before?

362
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,110
有过 两星期前
Yeah, like two weeks ago.

363
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,410
反正
Anyhoo...

364
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,850
别太晚了 不然X∑K兄弟会的小鲜肉们就被抢光了
Don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

365
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,830
谁拿了我的吹风机
Who took my hair dryer?

366
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,210
特蕾莎 是我 爸爸
Teresa, it's Dad.

367
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,960
我在餐厅等了你一个多…
I sat in that restaurant waiting for you for over an...

Surprise?

374
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,880
见鬼 小树 你下手也太狠了吧
What the hell, Tree?

375
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,630
我的天 对不起 我以为你…
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, I thought that you...

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,130
我只是想展示下校风

400
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,320
没想到因此被打了

不知道你还记不记得我的名字
I don't know if you remember my name or not.

434

And we've never met before?

439
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,300
昨晚之前没有
I mean, no, not until last night.

440
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
我的天哪 真是一场噩梦
Oh, my God. This is a nightmare.

441
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,920
请你搞清楚
I'm sorry.

442
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,000
是你想要和我回来的
You were the one who wanted to come home with me.

443
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,980
哥们 你把那个大美妞上了吗
Dude, did you hit that fine vagina?

瞧你干的好事儿 你个智障
Nice one, dickhead.

阻止全球变暖
Stop global warming?

446
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,490
说“不用”就好啦
A simple 'no, thanks' would do.

447
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,930
才坚持26个小时 你们就这点能耐吗
26 hours, that's all you got?

我给你发的短信你一条都没回
You haven't returned any of my texts.

455
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,030

Hey, you okay?

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,410
小树 怎么了 说点什么啊
Tree, what's wrong? Say something.

459
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,750
洛瑞 我
Lori, I...

460
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,650
我觉得我快要疯了
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

461
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,390
我不知道发生什么
I don't know what's happening to me.

462
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,550
别怕
Okay...

463
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,470
冷静下来 告诉我怎么回事
Just calm down. Tell me what's going on.

464
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,810
听着 我知道这难以置信
Look, I know this isn't gonna make any sense.

465
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,410
但是我已经过完今天了
But I have already lived through this day.

466
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,110
两次
Twice.

00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,210
小树
Tree, I uh...

468
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,610
不 不 不 相信我 我知道这听起来很疯狂
No, no, no. Believe me, I know it sounds totally crazy.

469
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,050
我向上天发誓 这是真的
But this is happening to me. I swear to God.

470
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,650
小树 我相信你是感觉你经历过了今天
Tree, I'm sure it feels like you...

471
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,440
好吧 你给我做了纸杯蛋糕
Okay, okay, you made me a cupcake!

472
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,720
为了我生日 对吧
For my birthday, right?

473
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,320
你准备给我的
You're about to give it to me.

474
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,900
今晚也会有惊喜派对
And then later on tonight, there's a surprise party.

475
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,680
呃 谁告诉你的
Ugh. Who told you?

476
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,880
是贝基吗
Was it Becky?

477
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,260
不 不 没人告诉我 我说我已经过完今天了
No, no! Nobody told me. That's what I mean.

478
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,280
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

479
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,720
我知道将会发生什么
I know what is going to happen before it happens.

480
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,570
- 你应该 - 洛瑞
- You should... - Lori.

481
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,550
洛瑞 有人想要在今晚杀了我
Lori, somebody's gonna kill me tonight.

482
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,850
噢
Oh...

483
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,070
好吧
Okay.

484
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,760
好吧 我懂了 谁让你设计我的
Okay, I get it. Who put you up to this?

485
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,480
- 是丹妮尔吗 - 不 不 不
- Was it Danielle? - No! No! No!

486
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,600
这不是开玩笑
This isn't some stupid joke!

487
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,450
这是真实发生的
This is actually happening to me.

488
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,550
我不知道谁要杀我
I don't know who's going to kill me.

489
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,650
但是肯定有人要杀我 我只是不知道是谁
But someone is. I just don't know who it is yet.

490
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,660
小树 你吓到我了
Tree, you're starting to freak me out!

491
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,060
你以为我不害怕吗
Well, how do you think I feel?

492
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,910
小树 看着我
Tree, look at me.

493
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,500
没有人要杀你
Nobody is trying to kill you.

494
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,030
不 有人要杀我 洛瑞
Yes, they are, Lori.

495
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,430
小树 看着我
Tree! Look at me.

496
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,730
我知道 今天对你妈妈和所有人来说都很难过
I know that today is hard, with your mom and all.

497
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,250
为什么你不翘课呢
Why don't you skip class?

498
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,580
请假休息一天
Just take the day off and get some rest.

499
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,680
我保证 明天你就好了
I promise you, you'll feel better tomorrow.

500
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,690
好吗
Okay?

501
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,210
混蛋 看看你还进得来么
Let's see you get in here now, asshole.

502
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,430
小树 为什么把门给锁了
Tree, why is the door locked?

503
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,550
我想一个人静静
Um... I just need some alone time.

504
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,470
今晚你什么时候去派对
What time are you going to the party tonight?

505
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,520
我不知道
I don't know.

506
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,980
我们的学费算是白交了
Ugh. Our tuition dollars at work.

507
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,060
无论如何
Anyhoo...

508
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,190
别来太晚 不然X∑K兄弟会的小鲜肉们就被抢光了
Don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

509
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,780
好的 拜拜
Okay, see you soon.

510
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,060
谁拿了我的吹风机
Who took my hair dryer?

511
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,600
新健身房开业
...opening a new gym.

512
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,520
我觉得这里面有点古怪 之前从来没听他提起过这个项目
Which is weird because I've never heard anything about it before.

513
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,880
我试着让自己不把这件事太当回事儿
But I'm trying not to let that bring me down.

514
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,900
因为我在接杰斯的路上
Because I'm on my way to pick up Jace.

515
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,250
我太高兴了 我要见到杰斯了
I'm just happy I get to see Jace, so.

516

I know, it's been like almost a month.

见到你我太激动了
I'm just so excited to see you.

518
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,390
洛瑞把遥控器放哪了
Where'd LorI put the freaking remote?

519
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,630
你好啊 杰斯
Hey, Jace!

520
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,800

Ain't that great.

528
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,810
我不知道你和那男的之间是
I don't know what's going on with you

529
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,610
怎么回事
and that other guy, okay.

530
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,640
因枪伤被送去抢救
...is being treated for a gunshot wound

531
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,690

Tombs was the subject of...

534
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,170
发型没新意
...boring hairstyle?

535
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,090
你是否为了让自己的秀发变得浓密
Do you go through a can of hairspray

536
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,270
而用了一整罐发胶
trying to get that full-volumized look?

537
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,220
那就用邦佩特喷一喷
Then bump it up with Bumpits!

538
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,320
就能达到专业美发效果
And get that salon-style look.

00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,140
你怎么想的
How's that going for you?

569
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,010
假设你说的有一丁点可能的话
Assuming that I believe any of this is even remotely possible...

570
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,260
你被困在今天一定是有原因的
There has to be a reason you're stuck in this day.

571
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,460
在你的一生中
Out of all the days in your life,

572
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,200
是什么让今天变得特别
what makes this day special?

573
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
或是什么让这一天有意义
What gives this day meaning?

574
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,170
- 什么都没有 - ♪ 哦耶 老子今天过生日 ♪
- Nothing. - ♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪

575
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,170
♪ 你丫倒是快点儿接电话啊 ♪
♪ And now you gotta pick up the phone ♪

576
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,660
今天你过生日吗
Its' your birthday?

577
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,740
- 是的 - 拜托
- Yeah. - Hello?

578
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,050
那又怎样 生日只不过是
So? Birthdays are just excuses to like

579
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,620
吃蛋糕和拆礼物的借口 根本没有任何意义
eat cake and open presents. There's no real meaning...

580
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,740
不 它有象征意义的 好吧
No, it's symbolic. Okay?

581
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,770
谁会在你生日的时候杀你
Whoever's killing you knows it's your birthday.

582
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,510
天呐
Ew.

583
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,320
好吧 听着
All right, look.

584
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,650
给我一张知道
Give me a list of names

585
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,890
你生日的人的名单
of everybody who knows it's your birthday

586
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,440
以及想要杀你的人的名单
and whoever's trying to kill you.

587
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,710
多亏了姐妹会
Well, thanks to my sorority,

588
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,370
差不多全校的人都知道我今天过生日
pretty much the entire school knows it's my birthday.

589
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,070
天呐 今晚他们还要给我办一个惊喜派对
God, they're throwing me this stupid surprise party tonight.

590
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,460
真的 谁都有可能杀了我
I mean, it literally could be anyone.

591
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,190
谁有动机呢
I mean, who has motive?

592
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,770
好吧 可能是丹妮尔
Okay, maybe it's Danielle.

593
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,830
好的
All right.

594
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,410
显然 昨晚我当着她的面
Apparently, I made out with some guy she liked

595
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,530
和她喜欢的男生亲热
right in front of her last night.

596
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,020
好吧
Oh.

597
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,690
一定是我们见面以前发生的
Must've been before we met.

598
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,780
晚上挺忙的哈
Busy night.

599
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
好吧
Okay, Mister I'm-gonna-

600
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,080
“捡尸体占人便宜”先生
take-this-drunk-girl-home- and-take-advantage-of-her.

601
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,600
不要对我评头论足
Don't judge.

602
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,510
我必须纠正一下 我昨晚并没有占你便宜好吧
For the record, I didn't take advantage of you last night. Okay?

603
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,420
我在瑞恩床上睡的
I slept on Ryan's bed.

604
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,570
所以 我们并没有
So, we didn't?

605
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,790
- 做那个 - 没有
- Have s... - No!

606
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,610
你昨晚喝大了
You were wasted last night.

607
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,040
我是怕你倒下
You know, I was afraid you were gonna fall or

608
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,250
像詹尼斯 乔普林一样 被自己的呕吐物呛死
choke on your own vomit like Janis Joplin.

609
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,950
我们说到哪了
Uh, what were we...?

610
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,520
- 嫌疑人 - 对 嫌疑人
- Suspects. - Right, suspects.

611
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,360
好吧 丹妮尔
Um, okay so, Danielle.

612
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,910
格雷戈里 还有他老婆
Pfff... Gregory? Um... his wife.

613
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
跟踪狂蒂姆
Creepy Tim.

614
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,260
哦 还有把我从TJ Max开除的那个小个子女生
Ooh, that tiny girl from T.J. Maxx that I got fired.

615
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,120
还有上周被我吐唾沫的优步司机
And maybe the Uber driver that I spit on last week.

616
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,680
我记得他叫 怎么嘛
I think his name was... what?

617
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,180
人无完人
Nobody's perfect.

618
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,440
好吧 这根本没用
Okay, this isn't helping.

619
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,670
毫无意义 是吗
This is pointless, isn't it?

620
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,220
好吧 听着 在我看来
All right, look, the way I see it, is, is...

621
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,460
你有了无限的生命
You have unlimited amount of lives.

622
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,180
所以你有了无限的机会去抓到杀你的人
So, you have unlimited opportunities to solve your own murder.

623
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,390
你的意思是 在我找到杀我的凶手之前
So, I'm just supposed to keep

624
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,650
我还要一遍一遍地死去
dying unitl I figure out who my killer is?

625
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,620
这就是你的好主意吗
That's your genius plan?

626
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,420
你有更好的办法吗

Dude, did you hit that fine vagine, or what?

689
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,340
怎么了

Hey, hey, hey, calm down. I-It's just me.

697
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,620
你还好吗
How you doing?

698
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,140
我怎么了
Wh-what happened?

699
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,850
今天早上你昏倒了
You collapsed this morning.

700
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,050
今天是哪天

星期一
It's Monday.

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,840
18号
Uh, it's the 18th.

704
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
我们试着联系你父母
Oh, we've been trying to get in contact with your parents.

705
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,780
但是因为一些原因
But for some reason...

706
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,540
- 吓我一跳 - 有事吗
- Jeez! - Can I help you?

707
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,540
我只是来看看她

我什么时候能出院
When can I get out of here?

714
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,700
你的病历真让我为难
I'm having a hard time pulling your medical records.

715
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,280
为什么
Why?

716
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,570
这是刚从影像科拿到的

717

这些重大外伤的标记

718
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,600
标明了疤痕组织和损害面积的严重程度
Given the severity of the scar tissue and the size of the lesions,

719
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,310
这听起来很奇怪 但
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

720
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,150
理论上说 你应该死了
technically, you should be dead.

721
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:03,850
嘿 你要干什么
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

722

我要离开这
I need to get out of here.

723
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,170
不行 你要留院观察
No way, no. You need to stay here for observation.

724
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,180
如果我不离开这 我会死
If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna die.

725
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,840
小树 嘘 听我说

730
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,090
你可以给我瓶汽水吗吗
Could you get me a soda?

731

00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,760
糟了 糟了 糟了
Shit, shit, shit.

753
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,900
警官 我知道我超速了
I know I was speeding, officer, I just...

754
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,400
请关掉引擎
Turn off the engine, please.

755
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,210
好的 警官
Yes, officer.

00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,450
驾照和车辆注册证
License and registration.

757
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,350
我
I um...

758
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,950
我没带
I don't have it.

759
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,620
- 你说什么 - 他还想杀我一次
- Pardon me? - He's trying to kill me again.

760
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,420
- 再一次 - 是的
- Again? - Yes.

761
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,920
我的意思是
I mean, no, I...

762
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,530
他以前想杀我 但这次我跑掉了
He was trying before, but this time I got away.

763
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,150
但是我没时间拿衣服了
But I-I didn't have time to grab my clothes

764
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,630
我的驾照在口袋里
and my driver's license is in my pocket.

765
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,700
女士 你是喝酒了
Ma'am, are you under the influence of alcohol

766
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,280
还是嗑药了呢
or any other controlled substance?

767
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,480
没有 我只是想
No! That is what I am trying to...

768
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,880
等等
Wait.

769
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,980
如果是 这是不是意味着
If I am, does that mean

770
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,430
你要逮捕我
that you're going to arrest me

771
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,310
把我关进监狱里
and lock me in a jail cell?

772
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,560
按照程序是这样的
That's how it usually works.

773
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,060
我酗酒了
I'm drunk.

774
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,360
- 真的吗 - 喝大了
- You are? - Wasted.

775
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,050
还嗑药了 药丸 大麻
And I'm high. You know, pills, weed.

776
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,650
我什么都吸
You name it, man, I'm on it.

777
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,350
既然这样
Um, well...

778
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,010
那我只能逮捕你了
Then I'm gonna put you under arrest.

779
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,420
好主意
That's a good idea.

780
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,800
让我帮你
Let me help you.

781
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,330
好吧
Uh, all right.

782
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,500
我还是第一次被抓
Never been arrested before.

783
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,900
哦
Uh-huh.

784
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,050

Thank you!

785
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:35,680

为什么要对我这样做
Why are you doing this to me?

792
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,270
你到底是谁
Who are you?

Silence!

799
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,700

Hey, uh, you know, I don't think you should be taking that many...

803
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,830
我的意思是 你可能会死的
I mean you could... you could die.

804
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,430
如果那么简单就好了
If only it were that easy.

805
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,630
劳驾拿下水
Water, por favor, mhm.

Hi, I'm the so-called "fine vagine".

808
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,000
如果你打算一直这么称呼女孩
If that's the way you refer to girls,

809

你就跟你的右手

815
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,870
嗯 你做噩梦了吗
So, you having a bad dream or something?

817
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,740
你刚才尖叫着醒来的
You were just screamin' before you woke up.

818
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,350

Well... I was dying.

819
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,700
又一次
Again.

820
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,310
什么意思
What?

821
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,400
呃 说来话长
Uh, it's a long story.

822
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,400
没事 我有时间
Well, I mean, I got, you know, time.

823
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,990
如果你想说的话 我随时奉陪
I'm not doing anything today if you wanna.

824
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,590
说实话
Seriously.

825
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,840
我讨厌这个贴纸
I hate this sticker.

826
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,440
嘿 等等
Hey, wait!

827
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,330
你为什么要跟着我
Why are you following me?

828
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,850
我想听听你的故事
I wanna hear your story.

829
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,550
听着 无意冒犯 但是上次
Look, no offense, but the last time

830
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,630
我跟你说的时候 并没有什么作用 所以
I explained it to you, it got me nowhere. So.

831
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,050
上一次
The last time?

832
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,450

所以你最近在做噩梦
So you-you're having bad dreams.

834
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,480
我选修了神经认知和梦理学
I took an elective course on neurocognition and dream content.

835
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,880
为你欢呼哦
Hooray for you.

836
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,480

I'm just saying, I...

837

我也许可以帮到你
I might be able to help, you know.

838
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,050
你能帮我停止重复度过同样的一天么
Can you help me stop reliving the same day

839
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,750
一遍又一遍 最后都被某个
over and over only to be murdered

840
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,550
我可能认识又可能不认识的人谋杀致死
by someone I may or may not know?

841
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,930
对 我觉得可以
Yup. Thought so.

842
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,430
阻止全球变暖
Stop global warming?

843
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:48,400
等等 你真的认为你在重复度过同一天吗
So, wait, you literally think you're reliving the same day?

844
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,700
是的
Yup.

845
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,900
然后某人会杀你
And somebody kills you?

846
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,100
是啊 一次又一次
Yup again.

847
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,800
好啦 你只是在糊弄我呢吧
All right, come on, you're just messin' with me, right?

848
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,430
洒水器
Sprinklers.

849
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:02,700
车鸣笛
Car alarm.

850
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,100
你看到那边兄弟会的候选人了吗
Now, see that pledge over there,

851
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,890
戴着棒球帽的伙计
the one in the baseball hat?

852
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,470
他马上就要晕过去了
He's going to fall right now.

853
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,960
别停下
Keep going!

854
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,040
还有问题吗
Any questions?

855
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,260
- 你的薯条好吃么 - 嗯 还不错
- How are your fries? Hmm. - Yeah, they're good.

856
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,530
真让人印象深刻
That's impressive.

857
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,280
呃 没什么啦
Hmm. That was nothing.

858
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,980
都排出去了吗
Did you get it all out?

859
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,380
随便啦 反正到时候你也不会记得
Whatever. You won't remember it, anyway.

He kinda always forgets.

是吗 我本该和我老爸在一起的

another uncomfortable celebration

872

假装一切都很好什么的
while we both pretend that everything is awesome.

873
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,650
你和你妈妈亲吗
Are you closer with your mom?

874
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,140
以前亲
Was.

875
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,430
发生了什么
What happened?

876
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,630
哦 她
Oh, she...

877
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,920
嗯
Yeah.

878
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,220
三年前
Three years ago.

879
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,940
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

880
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,440
那一定很糟
That-that sucks.

881
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,840
对啊
Yeah.

882
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,760
我们其实在同一天生日
We actually share the same birthday, though.

883
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,970
真的吗 难以置信
Seriously? That's crazy.

884
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,770
嗯 我小的时候
You know, when I was a kid,

885
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,450
总是逃学
I always got to skip school.

886
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,780
我们会去海滩
We'd go to the beach.

887
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:57,670
我爸就会给我们买那种超大的蛋糕
My dad would buy us this like huge birthday cake.

888
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:00,290
只放一根蜡烛在上面
And put just one candle on it.

889
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,280
我们就一起吹蜡烛
We'd blow it out together.

890
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,040
我打赌你肯定很想她
I bet you miss her.

891
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,150
嗯
Yeah.

892
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,010
说起来很好笑
You know, it's funny,

893
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,740
当你重复度过着同一天
you relive the same day over and over again

894
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,260
你就会开始发现真正的自己
you kind of start to see who you really are.

895
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,990
如果我妈妈现在看到我
If my mom saw me now,

896
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,110
看到我变成了什么样子
and who I've become,

897
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:29,580
我不觉得她会很自豪
I don't think she'd be very proud.

898
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,880
别这么说
Don't say that.

899
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,180
是真的
It's true.

900
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,110
我不是一个好人 卡特
I'm not a good person, Carter.

901
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:40,670
也许是罪有应得吧 我活该
Maybe it's karma, maybe I deserve it.

902
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:48,100
听着 我不是很了解你
Well, look, I don't know you all that well, but...

903
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,100
但改变永远不迟
It's never too late to change.

904
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,850
特别是如果你说的都是真的
I mean, especially if what you're saying is true,

905
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,110
每个新的一天都是
Each new day is

906
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:56,700
做一个更好的自己的机会
it's a chance to be somebody better.

907
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,470
看 就是这样
See, that's just it.

908
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:03,410
我不认为我还有多少机会了
I don't think I have that many chances left.

909
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,050
我每次回来都会变得更虚弱
I keep on getting weaker every time I come back.

910
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,800
我觉得 也许我就像猫咪有九条命一样
You know, maybe I'm like that cat with nine lives.

911
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,420
最终 我还是会死的
Eventually, I'm gonna run out.

918

导致一名警官死亡

919
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,130
图姆斯是全国通缉犯
Tombs was the subject of a nationwide manhunt

920
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:41,330
怎么啦

921

- 跨越四个州界后被捕 - 小树

有六名女性受害者

官方仍然不确定图姆斯是否为此负责
Authorities are still not sure if Tombs is responsible

924
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,190
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

925
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,300
他声称大多数受害者都在广袤沙漠里
for various victims he claims to have buried

926
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,420
- 被焚烧了 - 他一直都在这
- across the vast desert... - He's been here the whole time.

927
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,440

听着 蒂姆
Look, Tim.

994
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,200
我就直说了 我知道你是弯的
Let's get real. I know you don't like girls.

995
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,800
别再装了
Stop trying to be someone you're not.

996
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,800
真爱至上 对吧
Love is love, right?

997
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,100
你赶紧滚
Now you go out there

998
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:45,400
给自己找个好基友吧
and get yourself a fine piece of man ass.

999
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,700
♪ 爱情困在了我的思绪中 ♪

1007
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,640
我的老天
Oh, my God.

1008
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,340
你这个小婊砸鬼鬼祟祟地
You sneaky little biotch.

1009
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,640
他叫 卡特
His name's Carter.

1010
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,540
不 我们并没有上床
No, we did not have sex.

1011
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,840
但是 如果我能活过今天的话
But, if I finally make it through this day somehow,

1012
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,340
我要给他生宝宝
I'm gonna have his babies.

1013
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,040
很多事情得去做呢 得走了
Lots to do. Gotta go.

1014
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,340
某人总算是回来了
She finally rolls in.

1015
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,400
怎么了
What's wrong?

1016
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,700
- 嗯 - 哦 没什么 我只是
- Ugh. - Oh, nothing. I was...

1017
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,600
听着 洛瑞
Look, Lori.

1018
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,200
我一直都是最烂的室友
I have been the worst roommate.

1019
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,500
但你一直都陪在我身边
You've always been there for me

1020
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,960
但我太过自私 都没有感谢过你
but I've been way too selfish to even appreciate it.

1021
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,660
我们能重新来过么
Can we start over?

1022
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,360
我保证不会再像个混蛋了
I promise not to be such a loser.

1023
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,260
你嗑药了吗
Are you high?

1024
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,910
活明白了
On life.

1025
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:05,410
哦对了 我想听听你这个神秘男孩的事
Oh, by the way, I want to hear about this mystery guy.

1026
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,110
当剧烈搅动时
When extreme agitation occurs,

1027
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:11,710
对这种物质的活性响应水平检测表明
the locomotive response in the subject

1028
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,910
呈现出加速状况
shows an accelaration...

1029
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,310
巴特勒博士
Dr. Butler.

1030
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,020
我能和你单独谈一下吗
Can I have a word, please?

1031
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,220
你到底想要做
What the hell do...

1032
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,420
你知道你自己在做什么么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1033
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,820
我要结束我们之间的关系
I'm ending this.

1034
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,220
等一下 什么
Wait. What?

1035
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,220
我一开始就不该和你约会
I never should've started seeing you.

1036
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,120
这是错误的
It was wrong.

1037
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,420
然后 我
And I...

1038
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,420
总之 过去的已经无法改变 但是
Anyway, I can't change what I've done, but

1039
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,320
我可以今天开始试着成为一个更好的人
I can start trying to be a better person today.

1040
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,320
你从什么励志的小破书里学到这些的
What lame little self-help book did you get that from?

1041
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,420
你知道吗 你有一个那么爱你的妻子
You know what, you have a wife who loves you so much.

1042
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,620
所以 如果你不能对她忠诚
So, if you can't be faithful to her,

1043
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,420
至少你应该有勇气离开她
at least have the balls to leave.

1044
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,620
以后别想在我的课上划水了
Don't expect me to let you coast by my class now.

1045
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,820
我已经退掉了
Already dropped it.

1046
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,220
我想跟你们说
I just have to say

1047
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,220
当某些人在强制宿舍聚餐时缺席
how totally sad and disappointing it is

1048
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,320
我有多么
when certain people can't be bothered

1049
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,420
失望和沮丧
to make it to a mandatory House meeting.

1050
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,420
我们本应该讨论今年的慈善活动
We were supposed to be picking this year's charity.

1051
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,620
贝基
Becky...

1052
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,820
那是巧克力牛奶么
Is that chocolate milk I see?

1053
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,320
我还没吃早饭呢
I skipped breakfast.

1054
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,920
哦
Oh!

1055
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,120
好吃
Mmm, mmm.

1056
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,720
嗯 大伙们 这真的是太好吃了
Mmm, guys, it's so good.

1057
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,920
这是肥胖聚会的节奏吗
What's up with the fat fest?

1058
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,120
我们可是姐妹花辣妹
We're Kappas.

1059
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,320
来嘛 活的潇洒一点 一点卡路里又不会要命
Come on, hun, live a little. A few calories won't kill ya.

1060
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:55,520
不会死 它只是会让我像贝基一样
No. It'll just turn me into a chunker.

1061
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,220
变成大块头
Like Becky here.

1062
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,020
等等
Wait.

1063
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,120
我的天呐
Oh, my God!

1064
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,120
会没事的
It'll be okay.

1065
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,820
嘿 小树
Hey, Tree.

1066
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,520
嘿
Hey.

1067
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,720
我只是顺路来
I just uh, came on by to...

1068
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,320
这是干嘛
What was that for?

1069
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,720
我得走了 不过你晚上要做什么吗
I have to run, but what are you doing later tonight?

1070
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,110
没事儿
Nothing.

1071
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,450
你想带我出去过生日吗
Do you wanna take me out for my birthday?

1072
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,850
不会在逗我吧
What's the punchline?

1073
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,950
听我说 我知道看起来真的很随便 但是
Look, I know it's really random, but...

1074
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:54,850
我保证我明天都会解释给你的
I promise I'll explain everything tomorrow.

1075
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,550
假如有明天的话
Assuming there is one.

1076
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:58,250
答应就行了
Just say yes.

1077
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,650
好吧 可以
All right, yeah.

1078
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,150
太棒了
Cool.

1079
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,150
好
Okay.

1080
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,250
不好意思
Excuse me.

1081
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,050
咖啡多少钱
Can I pay for my coffee, please?

1082
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:28,750
- 你不吃吗 - 不了 结账就行了 谢谢
- You're not gonna eat? - No, just the check, please.

1083
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:30,330
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

1084
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,830
嘿 爸爸 抱歉我来迟了
Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late.

1085
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,830
我喜欢你的领带
Like your tie.

1086
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,630
谢谢
Thanks.

1087
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:52,030
学校生活还好么
How's school?

1088
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,330
挺好的
Fine.

1089
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,230
喜欢你的课程吗
You like your classes?

1090
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:00,230
还可以 爸 我不想再这样做了
They're fine, Dad. I don't wanna do that anymore.

1091
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,530
做什么
Do what?

1092
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:04,330
寒暄
Small talk.

1093
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,630
就是
It's just that

1094
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,100
今天
this day

1095
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
今天真的对我来说很艰难
this day is really hard for me.

1096
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,100
然后
And um...

1097
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,700
我很想妈妈
I miss Mom.

1098
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,240
你知道的 我非常的想她
You know, miss her so much.

1099
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,240
我想念她的微笑
I miss the way that she smells.

1100
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,140
我想念她的大笑
I miss that crazy horse laugh she has.

1101
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,440
我也是
Yeah, me too.

1102
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,740
我以前觉得
And I... I guess I thought that if

1103
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,640
如果我逃避这一切
I avoided all of it,

1104
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:46,440
逃避你的话 就会变得更容易一些
or avoided you that somehow it would be easier.

1105
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,640
但却并非如此
But it's not.

1106
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,440
只会变得更糟
It's been so much worse.

1107
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,140
逃避只会让我
All of this running and hiding

1108
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,320
更加悲痛
has made me so miserable.

1109
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,520
我觉得我终于想通了
And I think I finally figured it out.

1110
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,920
我是说 我做了一些很疯狂的事情 但是
I mean, it took something like totally crazy, but...

1111
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,820
但是我回来了
But I'm here.

1112
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
我爱你
And I love you.

1113
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,420
我真的 真的很抱歉我伤害了你
And I am so, so sorry that I hurt you.

1114
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,720
生日快乐 宝贝
Happy birthday, baby.

1115
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,620
保持镇静
Stay calm.

1116
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,220
慢慢站起来
I need you to stand up.

1117
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,120
慢慢地
Slowly.

1118
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,520
慢慢地
Slowly.

1119
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,620
好的
Okay, good.

1120
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,820
你这么做可不是个好主意
I guess this is a really bad idea.

1121
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,720
死了16次也不是
Well, so is dying for the 16th time.

1122
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,020
好了
Okay.

1123
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,020
现在 转过来
Now, turn around.

1124
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,620
我需要你认真听我说
I need you to listen to me.

1125
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,420
他就要逃走了
He's going to escape.

1126
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,120
有话好好说 把枪收起来
We could talk about this, just put the gun down.

1127
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
他就要跑了 快去找人帮忙
He is going to escape. Go get help.

1128
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,720
- 快去 - 好
- Go! - Okay.

1129
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,150
我知道你没睡
I know you're not asleep.

1130
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,650
睁开你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

1131
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,960
保险还上着呢 小姑娘
Safety's on, little girl.

1132
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,760
看看这是什么
Look what we have here.

1133
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,260
嗯
Mmm?

1134
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,080
你知道吗

It's a real nice surprise you comin' and visit me like this.

1136
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:14,560

我喜欢你
I like you.

1138
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,860
真是丢人
Damn shame.

1139
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,260
你就喜欢瞎闹腾 是吧
You're a feisty little shit, ain't ya?

1140
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,560
这就对了 爬吧 小姑娘 爬吧
That's right, crawl, little girl, crawl.

1141
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:32,760
别担心
Don't worry.

1142
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,160

I'll just make this one real quick for ya, okay?

1143
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,860

1144
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,360
保险去了 谢谢你的提示
Safety's off. Thanks for the tip.

1145
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,160
谁拿了我的吹风机
Who took my hair dryer?

1146
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,430
这是你
So this has gotta be like

1147
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:17,380
有史以来过的最奇怪的生日了吧
the strangest birthday you've ever had, huh?

1148
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,380
你都无法想象
You have no idea.

1149
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,980
你弄清楚图姆斯怎么越狱的了吗
Did you ever figure out how Tombs got free?

1150
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,990
不 没人知道
No. No one knows.

1151
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,920
嗯 大概吧
Yeah, I guess.

1152
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,720
你准备许什么愿啊
What are you gonna wish for?

1153
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,720
明天
Tomorrow.

1154
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,020
明天
Tomorrow?

1155
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,220
这不是理所当然吗
What, is that kind of a given?

1156
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,320
不许一个更好的么
Aiming for anything higher?

1157
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,920
不了
Nah.

1158
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,820
明天对我来说就足够了
Tomorrow's good enough for me.

1159
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,820
闭嘴
Shut up!

1160
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,320
♪ 哦耶 老子今天过生日 ♪
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪

1161
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,620

♪ And now you gotta pick up the phone ♪

1162
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,100
嘿 你醒啦
Oh, hey, you're up.

1163
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,600
卡特
Carter?

1164
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,700
对 你居然还记得我的名字
Yeah. I'm surprised you remember my name.

1165
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,600
昨晚你喝高了
You were pretty wasted last night.

1166
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,800
这不可能
This can't be happening.

1167
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,300
-这不可能 -什么
- This can't be happening. - What?

1168
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,760
我明明杀了他
I killed him!

1169
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,160
我明明阻止了他
I stopped it!

1170
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,260
谁 你在说什么呢
Who? What are you talkin' about?

1171
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,150
怎么啦
What's goin' on?

1172
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,150
你可能就是做了个噩梦
I mean, look, you were probably just having a

1173
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,250
或者什么的
bad dream or something.

1174
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:53,450
我睡觉的时候
Like it happens to me all the time

1175
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,350
也经常做噩梦 我是说我
when I'm dreaming, you know, I...

1176
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:00,220
瞧你干的好事儿 你个智障
Nice one, dickhead.

1177
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,420
某人总算是回来了
She finally rolls in.

1178
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,360
你要去哪里吗
Going somewhere?

1179
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
对
Yes.

1180
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,660
越远越好
As far away as possible.

1181
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,960
小树 怎么啦
Tree, what's wrong?

1182
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,160
我
Me.

1183
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,360
我错了
I was wrong.

1184
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,550
我以为只要我不逃避的话 我就能打败它
I thought that if I stopped running that I could beat it.

1185
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,250
但是它永远不会停下
But it's never gonna stop.

1186
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:20,850
小树你吓坏我了
Tree, you're freaking me out.

1187
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:22,650
对啊 那就是我 我很可怕
Oh, well, that's me, a freak!

1188
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,650
小树
Tree.

1189
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,270
小树 看
Tree, look.

1190
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,350
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1191
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,950
谢谢 但我昨天晚上已经吃了
Thanks. But I already ate it last night.

1192
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,280
哦 我的老天
Oh, my God.

1193
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,880
我在睡梦中死掉了
I died in my sleep.

1194
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,680
什么
What?

1195
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,980
你杀了我
You killed me.

1196
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,280
什么
What?

1197
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,280
你下了毒
You poisoned it.

1198
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,980
但我从来都没有吃过
But I never ate it before.

1199
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,680
所以你得找到别的办法
So you had to find another way.

1200
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,880
然后图姆斯刚好住进你的医院
Then Tombs fell right into your lap.

1201
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,480
完美的替罪羊
Perfect scapegoat.

1202
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,950
你能接近他
You had access to him.

1203
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,150
你先给他下了药吗
Did you drug him first?

1204
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,150
你知道如果他逃出来的话
You knew that if he escaped,

1205
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:48,850
所有人都会认为是他杀了我
everyone would assume that he killed me.

1206
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,350
但是其实一直都是你
But it was always you.

1207
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,450
小树 你在说笑么
Tree, are... Is this a joke?

1208
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,450
你觉得我会拿一个小蛋糕
You think I would actually try to poison you

1209
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,850
毒杀你吗
with a freaking cupcake?

1210
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:06,550
那好吧
Okay then.

1211
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,250
证明一下吧
Prove it.

1212
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,450
吃吧 洛瑞
Go on, Lori.

1213
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,030
咬一口
Take a bite.

1214
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,010
吃啊 洛瑞
Go on, Lori.

1215
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,410
你真的疯掉了
You really are crazy.

1216
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:28,910
那好吧
Okay then.

1217
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:30,910
我会把这个带到警察局去
I'll take it down to the police.

1218
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,010
我确定他们能告诉我们
I'm sure they can tell us

1219
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:34,250
你的小蛋糕是拿什么做的
what your little birthday treat is made of.

1220
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,950
你个愚蠢的婊子
You stupid little whore.

1221
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:47,250
我知道我是个坏室友 但是
I know I've been a bad roommate, but...

1222
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,550
这样不会太过了么
Isn't this a bit much?

1223
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,950
搞毛啊
What the hell?

1224
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,250
我也不知道
Oh, I don't know.

1225
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,650
也许是因为你一直和他睡吧
Maybe because you wouldn't stop sleeping with him.

1226
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:55,250
什么
What?

1227
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:57,250
格雷戈里
Gregory?

1228
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:02,650
他就是选择你不选我
But he just kept choosing you over me.

1229
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,250
他就是想要你这样的荡妇
I guess all he wanted was a cheap slut like you!

1230
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:11,250
等等 你就为了一个蠢男人不断地杀我吗
Wait, you've been killing me over some stupid guy?

1231
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:13,640
不只是因为这个
Oh, that's not the only reason.

1232
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,640
还因为你是个贱人
You're a dumb bitch, too!

1233
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,940
我想知道的是
What I really wanna know is,

1234
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,340
你怎么发现的
How did you figure it out?

1235
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,550
因为你已经杀过我了
Because you've killed me before.

1236
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:32,850
那我只能再杀一次了
Then I guess I'm just gonna have to do it again.

1237
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,500
住手
Stop.

1238
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,200
不 婊子
No! Bitch!

1239
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,500
去你的
Fuck you.

1240
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
不
No!

1241
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,400
发生了什么
What the hell's going on in there?

1242
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,200
没什么 小树摔倒了 都好着呢
Nothing. Tree just fell. Everything's fine.

1243
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,400
随便啦 小笨蛋
Whatever. Clumsy hos.

1244
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,900
聚会见啦
I better see you at the meeting today.

1245
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,110
聚会见
We'll be there.

1246
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,910
吃吧 婊子
Eat it, bitch!

1247
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:57,130
你们这些傻逼在做什么
What are you losers doing in there?

1248
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:58,530
洛瑞
Lori

1249
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,430
吃了
ate

1250
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,730
我的蛋糕
my cupcake.

1251
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:16,660
我就知道洛瑞有问题
I just knew there was something wrong with Lori.

1252
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:18,460
她从来都不化妆
She never wore makeup.

1253
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,460
从来不发什么可爱的自拍
Never posted any cute selfies.

1254
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,090
她居然还穿洞洞鞋
And she literally owned a pair of Crocs.

1255
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:25,190
所有迹象表明 她是一个变态杀人狂
All the signs of a psycho killer would...

1256
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:26,490
能小声点吗
Hello?

1257
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,390
我正在接受采访呢
I'm trying to get interviewed here.

1258
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:32,320
我的天 她真是个牛逼人物
Oh, my God, she is such a tool.

1259
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,520
不管怎么说
Anyhoo...

1260
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,320
洛瑞的杀人计划真是愚蠢
LorI's little plot was super lame.

1261
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,650
拿毒蛋糕杀人 想什么呢
Poisoning a cupcake? Really?

1262
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:40,150
我们可是姐妹花辣妹 我们不吃蛋糕
We're Kappas. We don't eat cupcakes.

1263
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,350
这是本地新闻还是全国新闻啊
Is this local or national?

1264
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:43,550
本地的
Local.

1265
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,150
- 嗨 爸爸 - 小树 你还好么
- Hey, Dad. Dad. - Tree, are you okay?

1266
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,350
- 你受伤了吗 - 爸爸 没有 我很好
- Are you hurt? - Dad, no, Dad. I'm fine.

1267
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:49,750
我保证
I promise.

1268
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:51,250
- 你确定 - 对啊
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

1269
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,550
就是擦伤了点
Just a little scratched up.

1270
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:56,450
- 好吧 - 好 待会见
- All right. - Okay. I'll see you soon.

1271
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,450
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你 拜拜
- I love you. - I love you, too. Bye.

1272
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:01,350
现在 你的卧室
So uh, now that your

1273
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:04,350
变成了一个犯罪现场
bedroom is officially a crime scene and all.

1274
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,450
你准备住哪啊
Where are you planning on crashing?

1275
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,150
那算是个邀请吗
Is that an invitation?

1276
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,250
你确定你还想在宿舍里醒来吗
You sure you wanna wake up in the dorm room again?

1277
