1
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,800
能给我拿一包Morleys吗？
Can I get a pack of Morleys?

2
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,170
小雪茄？明白了吗？
¿Cigarillos? ¿Comprende?

3
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,810
明白 明白
Sí, sí.

4
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,500
真心话还是大冒险 吉赛尔？
Truth or dare, Giselle?

5
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,900
求你了
Please.

6
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,040
求求你 我不想再玩这游戏了 求你了
Please, I don't want to play anymore. Please.

7
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,610
真心话...还是...大冒险？
Truth... or... dare?

8
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,820
啊 不要 不要
Oh, no! No!

9
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,520
抱歉 我别无选择
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

10
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,100
你们现在有这样一种选择
You do have a choice.

11
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
帮助他人建造家园
And I can honestly say the pure joy you will feel

12
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,310
说句心里话  从中你能收获非常纯粹的那种快乐
from literally building someone's home,

13
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,180
这种快乐会一直萦绕在你接下来的生命中
it will stay with you for the rest of your life.

14
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,380
你已经忘记的无数平凡之夜
Unlike all the nights you won't remember

15
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,110
还有那些你拼命想要忘记的宿醉之夜都无法与之相比
and the hangovers you're really gonna want to forget.

16
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,150
所以 作为度过春假的另一种选择
So, for a spring break alternative

17
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,080
这会让你的灵魂得到升华
that is really good for the soul,

18
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,620
请考虑加入仁爱社
please consider Habitat for Humanity.

19
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,890
好了
Okay.

20
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,890
嘿
Hey.

21
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,790
嗨
Hi.

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,160
我仔细考虑了一下 决定原谅你了
So, I've been doing some thinking, and I forgive you.

23
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,870
- 原谅什么？- 你说你不能来参加春假
- For what? - For saying you can't come on spring break.

24
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,200
我想你是跟我开玩笑的
I know you didn't mean it.

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
- 玛姬 - 嗯？
- Markie. - Yeah?

26
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,740
我爱你爱得深沉 这你知道的
I love you so much, you know that.

27
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,640
但我真没法去 我已经和仁爱社签约了
But I can't. I already signed up for Habitat.

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,310
- 我知道 - 而且我还是领队
- I know. - Yeah. I'm a trip leader.

29
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,680
这我知道 我知道 只是...
You know what, I know, I know. It's just...

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,750
只是 这是咱们最后一次春假了
this is our last spring break, ever.

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,820
一想到我最好的朋友不能一起去...
And the thought of doing that without my best friend...

32
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,320
我的心都碎了
that breaks my heart.

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,190
上高中以来 咱俩从没有分开超过一星期
Since high school, you and I haven't spent more than a week away from each other.

34
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,730
这是我们最后一次疯狂的机会
This is our last chance to have some fun

35
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,230
往后咱就天各一方了
before life tears us apart.

36
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,130
既然你都这么说了...
I mean, when you put it that way...

37
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,740
- 同意了 - 不 还是不行
- Yeah. - No. Still can't.

38
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,170
好吧 奥利维亚
Okay. Olivia,

39
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,040
"在你和全世界之间 我会选择你"  这句话还算数么？
what ever happened to "between you and the world, I choose you"?

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,280
- 当然算数 - 是吗？
- I still mean that. - Do you?

41
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,340
当然 大多数时间都算数 这次...
Yes, most of the time. This just...

42
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,680
这次是个例外
you know, isn't one of those times.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,400
好吧 我就直说了 我真不想这么干
Okay. All right. You know, I really didn't want to have to do this,

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,990
但你让我别无选择
but you've left me no other choice.

45
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,190
我替你解约了
I un-signed you up.

46
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,890
- 你说什么？- 没错
- You what? - Yeah.

47
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,720
我跟仁爱社说你得了疱疹
I told Habitat you got shingles.

48
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,030
好玩的是  这屋顶恰好也有疱疹似的东西
Which is kind of funny, 'cause roofs have shingles...

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,230
玛姬 你也太...
Markie, that is so...

50
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,730
- 聪明了 - 谢谢
- Brilliant. - Thank you.

51
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,130
如果这周你和我们去春假放荡一回
Okay, if you come with us for this one week of spring break debauchery,

52
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,900
夏天 我们全都帮你盖两周的房子
we will all build houses with you for two weeks over the summer.

53
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,340
- 不是说一周么 - 是两周
- We said one week. - We said two.

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,810
这有助于你申请医学院校
It'll help with your med school applications.

55
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,070
- 搞得我需要帮助似的 - 他也加入
- Like I need the help. - He's in.

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,340
整整十四天
Full 14 days.

57
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
所以怎么样 利维？
So what's it gonna be, Liv?

58
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,810
你是要单干一周呢
I mean, your feeble set of hands for one week,

59
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,750
还是我们大家帮你盖两周呢？
or all of ours for two?

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,810
这样你都不跟我们一起去的话
I mean, you're really just being selfish

61
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,150
那你就太自私了
if you don't come with us.

62
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,790
噢 天啊
Oh, my God.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,230
你这箱子里装的啥？
What did you put in here?

64
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,760
鞋
Shoes.

65
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,900
- 那办法管用吗？- 没准儿
- It worked? - Well, that depends.

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
夏天你真的会帮我盖房子吗？
Are you really gonna help me build houses this summer?

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,730
你说过"男人应该具备各种本领"的
You had me at "boys with tools."

68
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,000
执着是玛姬的唯一优点
And Markie's nothing if not persistent.

69
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,040
没错 这也是她最招人烦的一点
Yep, that is her most annoying quality.

70
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,080
你能一起去真是太好了 女童子军
Glad you're with us, Girl Scout.

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,010
你知道 我俩一直都是形影不离的
Well, you know we've always been a package deal.

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,850
我当然知道
Oh, yeah. I'm well aware of that.

73
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,890
- 是吗？- 是的 我对此没意见
- Are you? - Yeah. I'm okay with it.

74
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,390
嗯
Mm.

75
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,260
- 准备好了吗？- 早就好了
- You ready? - So ready.

76
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,690
- 那咱们走吧 - 走
- Okay, let's go. - Let's do it.

77
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,930
- 一切就绪了么？- 屁话
- Do we have everything? - Yeah.

78
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,860
出发
Now we do.

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,100
噢 喔 度春假去咯 婊子们！
Ow, ow! Spring break, bitches!

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,800
太对了 婊子们！
That's right, bitches!

81
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,820
墨西哥万岁！
¡Viva la Mexico!

82
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,780
就是这儿
There it is!

83
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,720
我们现在墨西哥
We're in Mexico.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,490
- 这里是罗萨里托海滩！春假快乐！- 春假快乐！
- Yay! - Rosarito! Spring break! - Spring break!

85
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,390
谁要喝啤酒的？
Who's ready for some cervezas?

86
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,290
- 玛格丽特酒 - 这是咱们喝的第4瓶了吧
- Margaritas. - Actually, this is, like, our fourth.

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,500
我爱你
I love you.

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,330
- 我爱你 - 真像个孩子
- I love you. - Such a babe.

89
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,330
- 天啊 - 我呢？
- My God. - What about me?

90
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,870
墨西哥
Mexico!

91
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,970
泰森马上要跳进海里
Tyson... is about to run into the water

92
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,840
然后被鲨鱼干掉
and get eaten by a shark.

93
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,110
- 春假快乐！- 啤酒时间 走
- Spring break! - Beer run. Let's go!

94
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,080
我们还没喝醉
We're not drunk yet.

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,850
你是直男吗？你是直男吗？你是直男吗？
Are you straight? Are you straight? Are you straight?

96
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,250
都是棍子 没有洞
All poles, no holes.

97
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,850
你懂的
You know that.

98
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,120
- 开个房间吧 - 这酒吧里都是孤独的灵魂
- Get a room. - Lonely souls here at the bar.

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,850
- 喝 喝 - 噢
- Drink. Drink. - Oh.

100
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,360
这是沙币！幸运符
Sand dollar! Lucky charm.

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,330
- 我是清醒的 - 哈？不是
- Sober friend right here. - Huh? Not!

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,470
小心 小心 噢 天啊
There, there. Yeah! Oh, shit! Oh, my...

103

- I love it. - Nice!

104
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,480
将要看到这视频的你们听着
If you guys watch this later,

105

- Love you, Pen. Love you, Brad. I love you, Ty. - Yes, we are...

108
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,450
咱别理这些辣鸡 走
Let's leave these losers behind. Let's go.

109
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,950
不嘛 我还想到另一个酒吧去玩玩
No, I just want to go to one more bar.

110
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,960
- 噢累 - 噢累
- ¡Olé! - ¡Olé!

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,220
我想趴在你身上
Oh, I want to lay you.

112
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,890
咱们回酒店去 走吧
Let's go back to the hotel. Come on.

113
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,970
一 二
¡Uno! ¡Dos!

114
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,840
一 二 三 四！
¡Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

115
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,450
喔哦
Wow.

116
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,290
他们真是如胶似漆
They are really going for it.

117
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,090
假如你无法击败他们...
Well, if you can't beat 'em...

118
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,890
你也要像那样吗？
- Oh-hoo-hoo. - Mm-hmm. - Just like that?

119
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,340
告诉我都发生了什么事
Okay. Tell me what's going on.

120
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,140
昨晚 在墨西哥...
Uh, last night in Mexico, and...

121
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,450
我们俩是唯二没有跳舞的辣鸡
and we're the only two losers not dancing.

122
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,010
呃 如果他们那样也算是跳舞的话...
Mm. If you can call that dancing.

123
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,950
确实不能算
Definitely not.

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
你打算传到YouTube上去吗？
Is that for your YouTube channel?

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,090
不是 不是
No. No.

126
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,090
YouTube只是招募志愿者用的
YouTube's for my volunteer stuff,

127
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,230
Snapchat才是找乐子的地方
and Snapchats are just for fun.

128
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,400
我要去找你那位美妞了
Um, I'm gonna go to the señoritas'.

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,030
- 一会儿就回来 - 没问题
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

130
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,030
过来  过来
Come on, come on.

131
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,470
嘿 我以为你不再乱搞了
Hey, I thought you were done with this shit.

132
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,140
- 你就要和卢卡斯搬到哥伦比亚特区去了 忘了吗？- 没忘 没忘
- You're moving in with Lucas, to D.C., remember? - Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,310
- 你到底在干什么？- 对不起
- What... what are you doing? - I'm-I'm sorry.

134
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,250
我太蠢了 我只是...
I'm so stupid. I'm just...

135
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,510
我只是喝醉了 好吗？
I'm just drunk, okay?

136
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,850
你真是我最好的朋友
You're seriously the best friend ever.

137
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,150
好
Okay.

138
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,120
- 你没事吧？- 没事
- You're good? - Yeah.

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,460
看我找到一个想跳萨尔萨舞却不会跳的人
Look who I found trying and failing to salsa.

140
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,660
太好了
Cool.

141
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,460
- 我没她说的那么差 - 嘿
- I wasn't that bad. - Hey.

142
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,600
- 嘿 - 我想你了
- Hey. - I missed you.

143
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,530
- 我想你 - 欢迎你回来
- I missed you. - Welcome back.

144
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,770
我也想你
I missed you, too.

145
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,570
听说你萨尔萨舞跳得不怎么样是吗？
So you weren't doing too well with the salsa, huh?

146
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,140
- 奥利维亚！怎么？- 罗尼？
- Olivia! What? - Ronnie?

147
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,250
嗨 你怎么在这儿？
Hi. What are you doing here?

148
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,410
噢 我是来找乐子的 你以为我来干嘛？
Oh, I'm just skiing. What do you think I'm doing here?

149
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,280
我正在度春假 你要加入吗？
I'm getting my spring break on. Do you want to join me?

150
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,150
不了 谢谢
No. Thanks.

151
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,150
嘿 玛姬在哪儿？也许咱们可以...
Hey, where's Markie? Maybe we could do, like,

152
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,220
- 玩一次三人行怎么样？- 你知道么
- you know, a little ménage à trois? - You know what?

153
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,990
她和她男朋友卢卡斯在一起
She's actually with her boyfriend, Lucas.

154
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,530
那就咱俩玩玩吧？
What about, like, a ménage à dos?

155
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,000
别做梦了 哥们
Not happening, pal.

156
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,030
是吗？碍着你什么了 哥们？
Oh, yeah? Is there a problem, pal?

157
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,270
没
No.

158
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,540
我只是很惊讶她没有给你脸上来一拳
I'm just surprised she hasn't punched you in the face yet.

159
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,940
- 也许她脾气比我好多了吧 - 噢 是吗？
- Guess she's nicer than I am. - Oh, yeah?

160
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,570
那我给你脸上来一拳怎么样？哈？
How about I punch you in the face? Huh?

161
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,940
肯定不会是我这周遇到过的最坏的事
Wouldn't be the worst thing that's happened to me this week.

162
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,980
够了 罗尼 冷静点
Okay, Ronnie, calm down.

163
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,310
说真的 算了吧
Seriously, you got to let it go.

164
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,020
好吗？我看到后面人在玩射击
All right? I saw  in the back. They're doing shots.

165
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,190
你真应该到那儿去看看
So you should really go check it out.

166
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,220
我非常喜欢射击 这大家都知道
I can't say no to shots. Everyone knows that.

167
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,490
所以我得走了 不是因为你说的那些话
That's why I'm gonna leave, not 'cause of what you said.

168
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,630
你觉得我脾气太好了吗？
You think I'm too nice?

169
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
这是好事儿
It's a good thing.

170
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
但在酒吧这种地方....
Except when dealing with guys at bars, so...

171
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,170
你可以直接叫我滚开
Feel free to tell me to piss off.

172
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,110
也许我就是喜欢礼貌点
Maybe I just like being nice.

173
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,050
能给我个机会吗？
Can I give it a shot?

174
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,350
- 我叫卡特 - 我是奥利维亚
- I'm Carter. - Olivia.

175
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,750
能请你喝一杯么？
Buy you a drink?

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,350
当然
Yeah.

177
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,990
再来一瓶啤酒
Another beer,

178
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,130
给这位女士来瓶玛格丽特
and... a margarita for the lady.

179
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,030
别这样
Come on!

180
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,570
附近肯定有通宵营业的酒吧
There's got to be an all-night bar around here somewhere.

181
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,570
房间里还有龙舌兰等着咱呢
We still have that tequila back in the room.

182
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,670
但这是我们在墨西哥待的最后一晚
But it's our last night in Mexico.

183
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,740
我不想回房间去
I don't want to go back to the room.

184
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,710
我知道有个地方可以去
I know a place we can go.

185
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,180
不好意思 你是哪位？
I'm... I'm sorry, who are you?

186
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,450
- 需要徒步走一段 但是值得的 - 呃
- Uh, it's a bit of a hike, but it's worth it. - Hmm.

187
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,180
当然你也可以直接叫我滚开
Or you can just tell me to piss off.

188
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,650
我想...
I think, uh...

189
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,090
回酒店房间待着挺好的
think the hotel room sounds pretty good, yeah.

190
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,530
- 没错 - 拜托 这是我们最后一次春假
- Yeah. - Oh, come on, it's our final spring break.

191
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,560
而后咱们就天各一方了
Before life tears us apart.

192
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,400
没错
Right.

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,570
马上就到了
We're almost there.

194
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,310
我应该穿登山鞋来的
I should have worn my hiking shoes.

195
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,610
要往这路上撒点面包屑么？
Should I lay down some bread crumbs?

196
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,010
等等 伙计们 小心着点
Wait, guys, be careful.

197
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,280
好奇这牌子说的啥 你西班牙语怎么样 布莱德？
Wonder what that means. How's your Spanish, Brad? Ow.

198
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,420
快 伙计们 咱们走
Come on, guys, let's go.

199
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,630
喔 这地方有点意思
Wow. This place is interesting.

200
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,100
- 还有点恐怖 - 啊
- Kind of terrifying. - Uh...

201
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,740
没啥恐怖的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

202
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,300
我保证
Promise.

203
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,570
没错 这比酒吧好多了
Uh, yeah, this is way better than a club.

204
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,710
嘿 你没事吧？
Hey. You okay?

205
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,110
没事 没事
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

206
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,280
- 只是有点累 - 没事 我们不会待太久的
- Just a little tired. - Yeah. We won't stay long.

207
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,490
龙舌兰呢？
Where's the tequila?

208
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,260
希望你们都打过破伤风
Hope you've had your tetanus shot.

209
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,130
我得尿尿
I got to piss.

210
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,700
- 太好了 谢谢 - 赞 赞 谢了 兄弟
- Nice. Thank you. - Cool, cool. Thanks, man.

211
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,340
噢
Oh!

212
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,780
啊
Ugh.

213
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,190
噢 哟 别紧张 是我
Oh! Yo! Chill out, O-dog, it's just me.

214
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,500
罗尼 你一直跟踪我吗？
Ronnie, did you follow me here?

215
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,730
不让罗尼参加派对比登天还难
You can't keep Ron-Ron from a party.

216
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,500
搞什么？
What the hell?

217
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,540
闻着真臭 这是什么....
This smells horrible. What is... what...

218
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,750
哟 给我来一瓶 兄弟
Yo, beer me, bro.

219
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,580
噢 好极了 罗尼来了
Oh, great, Ronnie's here.

220
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,820
意料之中 兄弟
Sure thing, bro.

221
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,320
呃 我们得...
Um, you know, we got to

222
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,260
- 我们明天得早起 所以..- 没错 - 没错 - 是的
- get up early, so... - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yes.

223
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,790
- 是的 是的 - 你们才刚到这儿
- Yeah, yeah. - You guys just got here.

224
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,730
- 不能就这样走了 - 是啊 急啥呢？
- You can't leave now. - Yeah. What's the rush?

225
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,700
呃
Um...

226
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,530
咱们来玩游戏吧
Yeah, let's, uh, let's play a game or something.

227
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,500
噢 对 像转罐子之类的
Oh, yeah, like spin the bottle.

228
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,610
- 好主意 那咱们就...- 咱们就玩真心话大冒险吧
- And on that note, let's, uh... - I was thinking Truth or Dare.

229
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,740
什么？那是小孩子玩的把戏啊...？
What, this a seventh grade sleepover, or...?

230
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,780
我知道是小孩子玩的 但 我们可以换种方式玩
I know it's a kids' game, but, I mean, if you play it right,

231
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,950
这可是了解你朋友内心秘密的好机会
it's a chance to expose your friends' deepest secrets,

232
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,320
也可以让他们做那些不愿做的事
and... make them do things they don't want to.

233
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,320
听起来确实带劲儿
That actually does sound kind of interesting.

234
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,990
呃...
Uh...

235
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,590
好极了 我们玩吧
Great. We're in.

236
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,890
好 大家站我后面
Okay, everybody, get behind me.

237
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,660
- 一 二 三 - 微笑 - 茄子
- And... one, two, three. - Smile. - Queso.

238
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,930
能给我加上标签吗？
Yo, will you tag me in that? Your boy.

239
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,000
很高兴你加入我们 罗尼
Glad you're with us, Ronnie.

240
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,910
额？
Well?

241
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,610
奥利维亚 真心话还是大冒险？
Olivia, truth or dare?

242
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,910
- 真心话 - 雷姆
- Truth. - Lame.

243
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,480
外星人
Um... aliens.

244
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,450
如果外星人现在降临 让你做如下选择
They land right now and they give you a choice.

245
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,620
杀了这里所有人 转身离开地球
They kill everyone in this room,and then leave peacefully, or...

246
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,730
或者杀了墨西哥的所有人
they kill the entire population of Mexico,

247
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,260
但我们毫发无损地离开
but we escape unscathed.

248
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,700
请选择
Choose.

249
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,500
这种荒谬的问题算什么？
What kind of ridiculous question is that?

250
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,270
- 这是个道德困境 - 我不在乎道德
- It's a moral dilemma. - I don't have morals.

251
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,840
- 你当然没有 - 很明显
- Of course you don't. - Okay, well, obviously,

252
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,440
- 她会选择我们 - 抱歉 各位
- she's choosing us. - Sorry, guys.

253
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,540
- 什么？- 你选择让外星人杀了我们？
- What? - You're gonna let aliens kill us?

254
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,680
我爱大家 但因此而让数百万人死去？拜托
I love you, but millions of people? Come on.

255
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,550
你得说真心话
You have to tell the truth.

256
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,980
- 我说的就是真心话 这是唯一正确的答案 - 随便吧
- I am. It's the only right answer. - Eh, whatever.

257
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,680
我已经开始厌倦了
Well, I'm bored of this already,

258
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,590
咱们还是开启派对模式吧
so let's get this party started.

259
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,490
- 你带我们来的 - 喔
- You brought us here. - Ooh.

260
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,690
我知道该怎么样让气氛嗨起来
Yo, I know how to amp this up a little bit.

261
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,960
- 咱不如来玩女孩上女孩的游戏吧？- 不
- Why don't we get, like, a little girl-on-girl going? - No.

262
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,060
- 罗尼 真心话还是大冒险？- 我倒想看看
- Ronnie. Truth or dare? - I'd watch that.

263
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,800
大冒险
Dare. Duh.

264
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,730
对着泰森跳30秒的大腿舞
I dare you to give Tyson a lap dance for 30 seconds.

265
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,640
- 没门 不 我不跳 - 跳吧 - 跳
- No way. No. I won't do it. - Yes. - Yep.

266
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,770
你一旦被问到 就算参与了 这是规则
Once you're asked, you're in. That's the rules.

267
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,970
不行 这里有三个女孩 你们不能让...？
No, there's, like, three chicks here. You couldn't dare...?

268
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,770
- 快 - 罗尼 - 这馊主意
- Come on. - Ronnie. - Yo, this sucks.

269
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,940
- 过来 - 太尬了
- Get over here. - So wack!

270
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,810
- 开始吧 - 上
- There you go. - Get it.

271
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,950
- 别给小费 别碰我 兄弟 - 开始吧
- Yo, no tips, no touching, bro. - Just do it.

272
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,650
- 别当回事儿 - 拿着
- Don't make this a thing. - Hold this.

273
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,820
- 别搞得怪怪的 - 这将会是我生命中最长的30秒 开始吧 快
- Don't make this weird. - This is gonna be the longest 30 seconds of my life. Let's go. Come on.

274
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,550
- 脱下来 - 好了
- Take it off! - All right!

275
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,020
- 噢 天啊 - 噢 噢
- Oh, my God! - Oh! Oh!

276
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,490
他以前肯定跳过
He's done this before.

277
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,960
而且还挺喜欢跳
Ooh, I think he kind of likes this.

278
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
看起来真是专业级别
We got a real pro here.

279
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,590
看看这技术
Look at that technique.

280
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
罗尼
Ronnie!

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,060
- 罗尼 罗尼 - 他以前跳过
- Ronnie! Ronnie! - He's done this before.

282
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,530
看啊
Look at that.

283
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,100
- 赏你点钱 - 我不要你的钱
- Make it rain pesos! - I don't want your pesos!

284
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,800
掌声支持一下
Aw. Cheer up.

285
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,070
- 怪难为情的 - 好了
- Weird. - Okay.

286
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,840
好了 卢卡斯 真心话还是大冒险？
All right, Lucas, truth or dare?

287
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,390
大家准备好了？
Okay, who's ready?

288
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,470
好了 伙计们 我保证 只是因为这里面太冷清了
Okay, guys, I promise you, it's just because it's cold in here.

289
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,370
- 我不评价 - 我眼睛受到了永久的伤害
- I have no judgment. - Scarred for life.

290
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,040
请不要鼓掌
Hold your applause, please.

291
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,570
谢谢
Thank you.

292
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,870
表演真精彩
Quite the show.

293
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,710
谢谢
Thank you.

294
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,440
好了 轮到玛姬了
Okay, Markie's turn.

295
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,510
我来问 真心话还是大冒险？
I got this one. Truth or dare?

296
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,510
真心话
Uh, truth.

297
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,490
你知道奥利维亚已经爱上你男友了吗？
Are you aware that Olivia is in love with your boyfriend?

298
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,060
- 不 她没有 - 拜托 这是显而易见的事
- No, she's not. - Come on, it's so obvious.

299
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,060
- 你能别这么三八吗？- 我只是说实话而已
- Will you stop being such an asshole? - Just being truthful.

300
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,700
- 嘿 泰森 闭嘴 - 别跟我说闭嘴
- Hey, Tyson, shut up! - Don't tell me to shut up.

301
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,000
- 你有毛病是吧？- 哥们 我们来这儿
- What the hell is wrong with you? - Dude, we're all here

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,570
就是因为她想让你产生嫉妒 这是明摆着的
because she's trying to make you jealous, like, clearly.

303
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,100
你为什么老是喜欢挑事儿 哥们？！
Why are you always starting shit, dude?!

304
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,040
- 有人说出真话是件好事 - 别说了
- Somebody tell the truth, that would be great. - Just stop it

305
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,670
按顺时针次序 现在轮到我了
with the agro-posturing and just get to my turn, please.

306
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,480
- 布莱德 真心话还是大冒险？- 真心话
- Brad, truth or dare? - Yes. Truth.

307
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,750
如果你必须和在场的某个人亲热 你会选谁？
If you had to make out with anyone here, who would it be?

308
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,420
你是双性恋也没关系
It's okay if you're bi-curious.

309
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,600
那个衣衫不整的家伙
Scruffy boy over there.

310
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,660
- 拜托 - 真是受宠若惊
- Come on! - I'm flattered.

311
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,870
泰森 真心话还是大冒险？
Tyson. Truth or dare?

312
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,870
- 大冒险 - 你必须停止卖假药方给新生
- Dare. - I dare you to stop selling forged prescriptions to freshmen.

313
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,040
- 噢 该死的 - 奥利维亚
- Oh, shit. - Olivia.

314
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,810
总是占据道德制高点
Always with the moral high ground.

315
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,780
小事一桩 其实我从高年级学生那儿赚了更多
Fine. I make more money off upperclassmen anyway.

316
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,210
噢 天啦
Oh, my God.

317
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,780
佩内洛普 真心话还是大冒险？
Uh, Penelope. Truth or dare?

318
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,520
- 大冒险 - 去跟奥利维亚亲热
- Dare. - Make out with Olivia.

319
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,220
- 罗尼 - 有何不可？试试嘛 好玩极了
- Ronnie! - Why not? Just try... It c-could be fun.

320
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,060
这有什么大不了的
- Just... - Didn't see that one coming.

321
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,130
没事的 利维 闭上眼睛就行了
It's okay, Liv, just close your eyes

322
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,830
- 假装他是卢卡斯 - 你知道么？
- and pretend it's Lucas. - You know what?

323
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,570
也许我是双性恋
Wow. Maybe I'm bi-curious.

324
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,940
紧
Tight.

325
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,840
贴得真紧
It's tight.

326
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,510
卡特 该你了
Carter. You're up.

327
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,710
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

328
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,140
真心话
Uh, truth.

329
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,150
你对我们可爱的奥利维亚有什么企图？
What are your intentions with our sweet Olivia?

330
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,160
我当时想找一个朋友多的人
I needed to find someone with friends

331
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,660
这样我就可以骗他们到这儿来
that I could trick into coming here.

332
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,100
我看得出奥利维亚是个容易上钩的人
I could tell Olivia was a pushover,

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,030
所以就把目标锁定了她
which made her an easy target.

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,040
我把你们带到这儿来玩这个游戏
I brought you all up here to play this game

335
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,780
因为....
because...

336
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,280
只要我能活下去 其他陌生人死不死我并不在乎
I'm okay with strangers dying if it means I get to live.

337
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,650
呃...
Uh...

338
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,120
抱歉 你当时本应该让我滚开的
I'm sorry, but you should've told me to piss off.

339
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,090
等等 怎么了？
Wait, what's up?

340
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,690
到底咋回事儿？
What the hell?

341
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,100
听着虽然很疯狂 但这个游戏是真格的
Look, I know, it sounds insane, but the game is real.

342
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,970
你一旦被问到 就算是参与进来了
Once you're asked, you're in.

343
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,040
明白吗？不管你跑到哪儿 不管你做了什么
Okay? Wherever you go, whatever you do,

344
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,770
它都会找到你 嘿 别 别
it'll find you. Hey, don't, don't.

345
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,170
要么说出真心话 要么完成大冒险 否则你就得死
Tell the truth or you die. Do the dare or you die.

346
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,710
拒绝回答的也会死...
Refuse to play and...

347
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,080
只需...只需要遵守规则就行
Just... just-just follow the rules.

348
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,630
伙计们？
Guys?

349
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,070
伙计们？
Guys?

350
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,820
你没事吧？
You okay?

351
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,950
没事
Yeah.

352
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,890
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

353
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,620
那人是个怪胎
Guy's a jerk.

354
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,890
想离开这儿吗？
Want to get out of here?

355
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,000
没错 现在离开最好 利维
Yeah. Great way to end the trip, Liv.

356
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,330
反正我也不喜欢那个家伙
Yeah, I didn't like that guy anyways.

357
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,210
快走吧 我们还能睡上一觉
Come on, we can go sleep in.

358
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,210
嘿 哥们 课堂见
Hey, man, see you in class.

359
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,820
待会儿喝咖啡
Coffee later.

360
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,290
你得保证下周回家一趟 儿子
Make sure you make it home next weekend, son.

361
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,920
明白
Gotcha.

362
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,690
嗨
Hi.

363
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,290
嘿
Hey.

364
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,290
和你的警官老爹有矛盾吗？
All good with Officer Dad?

365
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,960
噢 相当有
Oh, absolutely.

366
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,130
他以为我上周一直
Now that he thinks I spent my last week

367
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,830
在和我不存在的女朋友喝酒做爱
belly-bumping my nonexistent girlfriend in wine country.

368
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,670
你的那位加拿大女友确实喜欢喝梅鹿汁酒
Well, your Canadian lady, she really does like a good Merlot.

369
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,140
她名字叫金伯莉
Uh, her name is Kimberly,

370
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,670
- 而且她现在的品味要好多了 谢谢 - 噢
- and her palate is quite refined, thank you. - Oh.

371
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,110
抱歉 对你的加拿大小金说声抱歉
Sorry. My apologies to Canadian Kim.

372
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,050
你倒提醒我了 我为什么不找个千里之外的学校念书
Remind why I didn't go to school thousands of miles away

373
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,050
远离我那个傲慢而恐同的老爹
from my overbearing and homophobic father.

374
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,720
- 因为你从没对他说不 - 呃
- Because you never say no to him. - Hmm.

375
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,990
那样你也不会遇到我了
And you never would've met me.

376
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,420
你真的不想当我的备胎吗？
Are you sure you don't want to be my beard?

377
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,760
因为我确实需要一位像金伯莉那样的女人
'Cause I really want to ghost Kimberly.

378
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,190
听着不错 这样我们俩面对的问题都一并解决了
Yeah, I doubt that would solve either of our problems.

379
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,800
- 玛姬怎么样了？- 我不知道
- How is Markie? - I don't know.

380
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,730
那晚回来后 就没有和她多聊
Haven't talked to her much since we've been back.

381
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,370
别担心 我们是一辈子的好友
Don't worry about us. We're friends for life.

382
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,810
- 拜 - 拜拜
- Bye. - See ya.

383
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,210
- 嗨 奥利维亚 - 嘿
- Hi, Olivia. - Hey.

384
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,000
（真心话还是大冒险？）

385
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,810
- 给 - 上帝保佑你
- Here you go. - God bless you.

386
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,950
嘿 我们做了鸡尾酒
Hey. We made mojitos!

387
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,380
要尝尝吗？
Study party?

388
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,450
- 待会儿吧 - 噢 好吧
- Yeah, maybe later. - Oh, okay.

389
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,890
奥利维亚
Olivia,

390
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,950
佩说我在墨西哥的时候
um, Pen was saying that I was

391
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,420
做的有点过分 所以给你这个
a bit of dick in Mexico, so... here's a little something

392
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,160
- 作为补偿 - 药方？
- to make it up to you. - A prescription?

393
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,430
- 怎么了？你不是新生 - 你也不是医生
- What? You're not a freshman. - Yeah, you're not a doctor.

394
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,940
我的幸运钢笔可不这样认为
That's... not what my lucky pen says.

395
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
我以为我才是你的幸运佩
I thought I was your lucky Pen.

396
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,780
哦 宝贝 你是我的幸运佩内洛普
Oh, baby, but you are my lucky Penelope.

397
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,910
- 噢 我的幸运佩 - 泰森 泰森
- Oh, my lucky Pen! Oh! Oh! - Tyson! Tyson!

398
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
（真心话还是大冒险？）

399
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,800
罗伊·卡梅伦 45岁 现在他想做晚餐
Roy Cameron, 45 years old, attempts to make dinner.

400
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,230
看一看
Take one.

401
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,140
请对我有点信心
A little faith, please.

402
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,440
没人像你老爸这样做牛排的
Nobody makes a steak like your old man.

403
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,170
爸 我现在很悲观
Uh, Dad, I'm pescatarian now.

404
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,510
所以我要说....
Right. And that's why I meant to say...

405
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,410
剑鱼牛排 咚
swordfish steaks! Boom!

406
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,020
- 天啊 你样子好傻 - 但你还是爱我的对吗？
- God, you are such a dork. - But you still love me, right?

407
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,350
当然 当然 我爱你
Yeah, yeah, I still love you.

408
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,060
好
Good.

409
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,970
利维 希望你的疱疹已经好了 很快就有新视频吗？

410
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,970
{\pos(130,230)}凯西@仁爱社
新视频？

411
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,080
- 打扰了 - 嗨
- Sorry. - Hi.

412
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,550
给你带礼物来了
Come bearing gifts.

413
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,380
佩内洛普说你刚才不想喝
Penelope said you didn't want one.

414
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,220
其实我才更了解你
I know you better than that.

415
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,350
没错 你说对了 现在有点想喝酒
Yeah, you're right. Probably could use a drink.

416
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,360
自从墨西哥那晚以来
So, I know things have been...

417
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,400
咱们之间产生了一点嫌隙
a little Bette and Joan between us since Mexico,

418
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,190
但所有不快都就此打住吧
but... awkwardness stops here.

419
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,560
好吗？我爸自杀之后
Okay? And since my dad took his life,

420
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,330
你就是我唯一的亲人了
y-you've been my only family.

421
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,000
我唯一可以信赖的人
The one person I can really trust.

422
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,270
所以不管泰森怎么胡说
So I'm not gonna let a stupid comment by Tyson,

423
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,510
不管其他所有人怎么说 都改变不了这一点
of all people, change that.

424
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,980
玛姬 我向你保证
Markie, I promise you,

425
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,150
我没有对你男朋友产生爱意
I do not have feelings for your boyfriend.

426
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,050
我把他当哥们一样对待 明白吗？
He's like a brother to me, okay?

427
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,190
明白 没问题
Okay. Yeah.

428
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,520
在你和全世界之间 我选择你
Between you and the world, I choose you.

429
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,990
我也选择你
And I choose you.

430
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,490
噢 天啊
Mm. Oh, my gosh.

431
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,060
- 这....- 喔
- That is... - Wow.

432
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,500
- ...味道太猛了- 没错
- ...very strong. - Yeah.

433
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,520
（真心话还是大冒险）

434
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,210
想想你妈妈 ...
Think about your mom, and, like,

435
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,080
有时候就是会那样
it just happens sometimes...

436
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,050
嘿 混蛋
Hey, asshole.

437
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,050
你觉得这很好玩吗？
Do you think that's funny?

438
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,450
觉得什么好玩？
Think what's funny?

439
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,350
我不明白你说啥
I-I don't get it.

440
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,190
写在我桌子上或是传单上都无所谓
My desk and the flyer were harmless,

441
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,660
但刻在车上要花很多钱洗干净的
but it's gonna cost me a lot of money to fix my car.

442
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,360
够了 我完全懵了 你在说什么？
Okay, I am so lost right now. What are you talking about?

443
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,560
你把"真心话还是大冒险"刻在我车门上了
You keyed "truth or dare" into my car door.

444
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,630
你车门上什么也没有
There's nothing on your car.

445
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,500
别开这种蹩脚的玩笑
Except your idea of a lame joke.

446
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,400
你有点神经质 但你知道吗？
Okay, you're a little crazy. But you know what?

447
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,970
我其实很喜欢神经质的
I actually happen to like crazy.

448
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,310
也许咱可以约个时间喝上一杯？
Do you want to maybe get a drink sometime?

449
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,510
别来烦我懂吗？
Will you just leave me alone? Okay?

450
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,450
这是拒绝了吗？
Is that a no?

451
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
嘿 萨拉 你看见玛姬了吗？
Hey, Sarah, have you seen Markie?

452
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,320
她在图书馆
In the library.

453
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,990
嘿 奥利维亚
Hey, Olivia.

454
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,130
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

455
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,960
你刚说什么？
What did you say?

456
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,500
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

457
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,640
真心话还是大冒险？真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

458
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
真心话还是大冒险？真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

459
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,410
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

460
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,350
真心话还是大冒险？真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

461
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,180
真心话还是大冒险？真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

462
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,480
- 真心话还是大冒险？真心话还是大冒险？- 真心话！别说了
- Truth or dare? Truth or dare? - Truth! Stop!

463
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,450
你帮你最好朋友隐瞒了什么秘密？
What secret does your best friend make you hide?

464
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,590
玛姬一直都在背着卢卡斯乱搞
Markie's constantly cheating on Lucas!

465
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,270
那是真的吗？
That true?

466
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,070
玛姬...
Markie...

467
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,410
卢卡斯
Luke.

468
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,380
卢卡斯
Lucas.

469
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,580
- 等等 - 玛姬 我不知道发生了什么事
- Wait. - Markie, I don't know what's going on.

470
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,150
你把他当哥们看待对吗？
He's like a brother to you?

471
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,380
不 说真的 我刚才看见了些奇怪的东西
No, I'm serious. I'm seeing things.

472
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,120
再碰我就打断你手臂
Touch me again, and I'll break that hand.

473
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,670
- 太疯狂了 - 是真的
- That's insane. - Seriously.

474
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,550
哟 你好吗？想一块玩玩吗？
Yo. 'Sup? You want to play?

475
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,310
你看起来像是个很会玩球的女孩
You look like a girl who's good with balls.

476
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,450
别来烦我
Please do not talk to me.

477
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,120
别价 就玩个游戏而已
No, look, uh, just one game.

478
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,190
- 我只是想让你看看我的球杆而已 - 好吧
- Like, I just want to show you my pool cue. - Okay.

479
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,690
我说的球杆 就是鸡鸡的意思
And by "pool cue," I mean penis.

480
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,420
说到鸡鸡 也许咱们可以上个床之类的
I'm referring to my penis. Maybe we could have sex.

481
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,290
看看会发生什么
You know, see what happens.

482
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,270
真心话还是大冒险 罗尼？
Truth or dare, Ronnie?

483
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,070
什么 是奥利维亚让你这么做的吗？
What, did Olivia put you up to this?

484
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,340
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth... or dare?

485
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,610
有点怪 但也有点性感
Uh, creepy... and sexy.

486
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,680
那就玩玩吧 大冒险
Let's do it. Dare.

487
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,810
到桌子上去 给大家看看你的球杆
Get on the table and show everyone your pool cue.

488
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,780
我就知道你会这么说 好吧
I knew it. Okay. All right.

489
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,290
大家好 各位乡亲父老
Hello, friends and neighbors!

490
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,820
这位漂亮的小姐让我
This fine young lady here has asked me

491
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,490
陪她玩真心话大冒险的游戏
to play a little game of Truth or Dare with her,

492
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,290
作为一名真男人和绅士 我选择了大冒险
and like a real gentleman, I chose dare!

493
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,330
- 加油 罗尼 - 唬
- Go, Ronnie! - Whoo!

494
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,460
现在 我非常荣幸地...
Anyway, now I will do you all the honor

495
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,330
给大家展示一下我的传家之宝
of showing you my business.

496
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,500
以前见过了 没什么鸟不起
Seen it before! Not impressed!

497
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,810
噢
Oh!

498
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,540
- 是谁在说话 贝丝吗？- 不是 但贝丝也说过你的太小了
- Who is that, Beth? - No, but Beth said it was tiny, too.

499
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,810
不 贝丝绝不会说这种话
No, uh, Beth would never say that!

500
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,750
好吧 就这样吧 我不是...
Okay, you know what, screw this, I'm not...

501
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,460
当心点 哥们 这有根球杆
Whoa, careful! Dude. Hey, watch the pool cue, man.

502
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,860
谢谢你
Thank you.

503
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,880
快打911报警
Somebody call 911!

504
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,910
我发誓 当时有很多人围着我说话
I swear to you, people were talking to me.

505
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,750
他们脸看上去加了Snapchat上的搞怪滤镜
It looked like a messed-up Snapchat filter.

506
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,480
他们不停地问我"真心话还是大冒险"
They were asking me "truth or dare" over and over again,

507
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,220
然后我就慌了
and... I-I panicked.

508
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,520
你是说一群暴民整齐划一地念咒
So you're saying a mob of people

509
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,860
逼得你说出了玛姬一直在背着卢卡斯乱搞这事
chanting in unison made you tell Lucas that Markie is a cheating whore.

510
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,560
这听起来很疯狂
Look, I know it sounds insane.

511
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,760
- 有点疯狂 - 但这确实发生了
- Just a little. - But it happened.

512
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,500
自从墨西哥那晚后
Something really weird

513
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,270
诡异的事情不断发生
has been going on ever since Mexico.

514
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,930
噢 拜托
Oh, come on.

515
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,200
保守这样一个秘密本来就很困难
Uh, keeping a secret like that, it's a huge burden.

516
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,340
我们都不会责怪你 把真话吐露出来
None of us would fault you for trying to get it off your chest.

517
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,610
只是 也许不该在大庭广众面前说
I mean, n-not maybe so publicly.

518
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,610
我希望你放到YouTube上去说
I wish you would have done it for your YouTube channel.

519
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,920
- 当心我用这个刺你 - 冷静点 宝贝
- I will stab you with this. - Calm down, baby.

520
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,820
又是贝丝
Basic Beth again.

521
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,330
天啊
Holy shit.

522
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,660
抱歉
Excuse me,

523
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,370
各位乡亲父老
friends and neighbors!

524
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,470
这位漂亮的小姐让我
This fine young lady right here has asked me

526
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,670

- and like a real gentleman, I chose dare. - Go, Ronnie!

527
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,380
现在 我非常荣幸地...
Anyway, now I will do you all the honor

528
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,410
给大家展示一下我的传家之宝
of showing you my business.

529
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,580
- 恶心 - 呃
- Gross. - Ugh.

530
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,290
快打911报警
Call 911!

531
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,860
丢人了
Bad break.

532
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,630
- 开个玩笑而已 - 这不好笑
- It's a pool joke. - That's not funny.

533
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,600
- 是那天那个游戏在作祟 - 什么？
- It's the game. - What?

534
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,800
- 它跟着我们回来了 - 你说真的么？
- It is. It followed us home. - Are-are you being serious?

535
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,840
卡特对我说过这是真格的
Carter told me that it was real,

536
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,610
我们全都参与了 它会找到我们
that we were all in, and that it would find us.

537
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,770
你要把那个精神不正常的导游的话当真吗？
We're really taking the word of our mentally unstable tour guide?

538
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,240
那怎么解释我在图书馆发生的事？
How else do you explain what happened to me in the library?

539
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,250
- 哈？罗尼呢？- 我不知道
- Huh? And now Ronnie? - Oh, I don't know.

540
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,910
可能他只是喝醉了 掉下台球桌而已
Maybe he was drunk and he fell off a pool table,

541
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,150
- 那是个意外 - 所以他选择大冒险也是个意外吗？
- which is what happened. - So, it's just a coincidence that he was supposed to be doing a dare?

542
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,680
大家都冷静一下
Let's just calm down.

543
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,290
- 没错 - 不 卡特说过 "要么说真心话 不然就死"
- Yes. - No. Carter said, "Tell the truth or you die.

544
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,820
"要么完成大冒险 否则就死" 罗尼临阵脱逃
Do the dare or you die." Ronnie chickened out.

545
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,960
他没有完成大冒险 所以他死了
He did not do his dare, and now he's dead!

546
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,300
伙计们 看出来我没疯了吧
Guys, tell me I'm not crazy!

547
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,660
不 你听起来确实像疯了
Oh, no, you definitely sound crazy.

548
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,500
卢卡斯
Lucas.

549
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,510
我很抱歉我说过的话
I am so sorry for what I said,

550
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,470
但我发誓
but I swear to you,

551
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,470
我是在被某些东西强迫下才说的
something forced me to say that.

552
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,280
希望你能相信我
And I need you to believe me.

553
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,480
拜托
Please.

554
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,620
很难相信一个对你说了这么久谎的人
Kind of hard to believe someone who's been lying to you for so long.

555
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,660
再见了 大家
See you, guys.

556
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
现在 我非常荣幸地...
Anyway, now I will do you all the honor

557
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,330
给大家展示一下我的传家之宝
of showing you my business.

558
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,510
卢卡斯
Lucas.

559
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,430
卢卡斯
Lucas.

560
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,280
（真心话还是大冒险）

561
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,690
卢卡斯
Lucas.

562
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,310
真好玩啊 伙计们
That's very funny, guys.

563
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,840
这太过火了
Okay, this is insane.

564
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,160
（真心话还是大冒险）

565
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
嘿
Hey.

566
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,870
我信你了
I believe you.

567
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,910
有东西在我手臂上烙了"真心话还是大冒险"
Something started burning "truth or dare" into my arm.

568
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,480
- 噢 天啊 你没事吧？- 没事
- Oh, my God, are you okay? - Y-Yeah.

569
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,780
字已经消失了现在
Yeah, I mean... it's gone now.

570
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,180
但 我感觉到了
But... I felt it.

571
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,720
奥利维亚 非常疼
Olivia, it was really painful.

572
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,690
没错 我在图书馆的时候也是这样
Yeah, and when I was in the library,

573
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,860
我被一堆人围着 但那都是幻觉
I was surrounded by people, but what we're seeing is not real.

574
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,790
只有随之产生的后果是真的
Only the consequences are.

575
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,900
你回答了吗？
Did you answer?

576
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,840
卢卡斯 你必须回答
Lucas, you have to answer.

577
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,540
第一次遇见奥利维亚 我就对她产生了感觉
I've had feelings for Olivia since we met.

578
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,180
我不时想象和她在一起 而不是玛姬
Sometimes I wonder what it would be like

579
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,120
将会是一种什么样的感觉
to be with her instead of Markie.

580
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,820
我也幻想过在她身边起床...
And I wonder what it would be like to wake up next to her...

581
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,820
然后亲吻她
and kiss her.

582
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,690
但我知道那是不可能发生的事
But I know that can never happen.

583
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,600
天啊 别告诉我你已经挂掉了电话
Oh, God, please tell me you didn't hang up.

584
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,870
我们得去说服其他人
We have to convince everybody else.

585
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,810
我来了
I'm coming.

586
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,750
这是在干什么？
What is all this?

587
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,120
联合调解吗？
An intervention?

588
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,220
我一直以为喜欢白天也喝酒的佩内洛普才是第一个需要开导的
I always thought day-drinking Penelope would be first.

589
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,520
谢谢
Thanks.

590
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,960
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

591
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,890
我就住这儿
I live here.

592
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,490
到底是什么事？
So, what is it all about?

593
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,230
那个游戏
The game.

594
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,930
我们现在仍然处于在墨西哥玩的那个游戏中 顺序也一样
We're still playing it in the same order we played in Mexico.

595
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,000
卡特说的是实话 那个游戏是真格的
Carter told us the truth; the game is real.

596
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,670
第一个轮到的是我 我在图书馆被逼问
First, it was my turn, I got asked in the library, and

597
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,540
说出了你的秘密 然后是罗尼
it made me tell your secret; then it was Ronnie's turn,

598
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,940
他没有完成大冒险 所以它杀死了他
he didn't do his dare, and it killed him.

599
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,710
也许你和罗尼都不应该回答
Maybe you and Ronnie shouldn't have answered.

600
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,080
卡特说过"拒绝回答也会死"
Carter also said, "Refuse to play and you die."

601
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,620
我今晚被问了 我本想置之不理
I got asked tonight, and I tried to ignore it.

602
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
但它就把"真心话还是大冒险"烙进了我胳膊
But then something burned "truth or dare" on my arm.

603
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,890
给我看看
Show me.

604
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,750
现在消失了 但...
I mean, it's gone now, but...

605
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,830
- 手上啥也没有 - 我说的是真话
- Th-There's nothing there. - Because I told the truth.

606
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,100
- 噢 天啊 - 奥利维亚
- Oh, my God. Geez. - Wow. Olivia.

607
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,900
这是新花招吗
I mean, this is next-level.

608
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,730
你不想为当众羞辱我
You can't take responsibility for humiliating me

609
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,900
破坏我的人际关系而负责
in front of everyone and ruining my relationship,

610
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,940
所以你又想出了这么个疯狂的借口
so you come up with some insane story

611
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,910
居然说是一个游戏逼你的？
that a game made you say it?

612
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,740
你还请卢卡斯来帮你骗我
Then you get Lucas to lie for you.

613
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,540
- 滚 我受够了 - 玛姬
- No, I'm done. - Markie.

614
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,880
玛姬 别走
Markie. Stop.

615
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,850
- 你不能一个人待着 - 为什么不能？
- You can't be alone. - Why not?

616
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,080
因为在这张照片中 下一个就轮到你了
Because in the picture, your turn is next.

617
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,700
未知号码 当然咯
Unknown number. Of course it is.

618
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,600
- "真心话还是大冒险？" 喔 是条短信 真的吗？- 哈
- "Truth or Dare?" Wow, a text. Really? - Huh.

619
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,900
- 人类是不可能发出未知号码的...- 快回答
- I mean, there's no way a human could have sent... - Just answer it.

620
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,770
好吧
Fine.

621
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,770
大冒险
Dare.

622
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,240
"你要兑现你说过的话
"Dare you to follow through with your promise.

623
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,340
打断奥利维亚的手臂"
Break Olivia's hand."

624
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,110
明显是你在搞鬼
Obviously, this was you.

625
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,250
你看我现在有在发信息吗？
Do you see me texting you right now?

626
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,120
但你是唯一听到我说这话的人
No, but you were the only one there when I said that.

627
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,250
玛姬 我为什么要让你打断我的手臂？
Markie, why would I dare you to break my own hand?

628
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,190
我不知道 也许你正在为你的YouTube频道
I don't know! Okay, maybe you're making

629
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,850
拍摄新的视频 讲解怎样和朋友绝交
a new YouTube video on how to lose friends.

630
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,090
这更是胡扯
Oh, that seems even less likely.

631
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,060
- 你在干什么？- 你必须这么做
- What are you doing? - You have to do it.

632
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,800
什么？
What?

633
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,030
你必须这么做
You have to.

634
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,040
罗尼没有完成大冒险 现在他死了
Ronnie didn't do his dare, and now he's dead.

635
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,740
- 利维 这太疯狂了 - 即使按我的标准来看 也是如此
- Liv, this is so messed up. - Even by my standards.

636
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,140
听着 我现在确实很生你的气
Look, as pissed as I am at you right now...

637
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,210
非常生气 但我绝不会想要打断你的手臂
and I'm so pissed... there's no way I'm gonna break your hand.

638
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,110
你别无选择
Well, you don't really have a choice.

639
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,820
快拿着
So just take it. Please.

640
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,020
玛姬 如果你不这么做 后果不堪设想
Markie, I don't want to find out what happens if you don't.

641
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,860
快动手
Just do it.

642
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,170
- 不 我不能 - 天啊 相信我一次吧 玛姬
- No, I-I can't. - God, just trust me, Markie!

643
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,140
快动手 拜托
Do it. Please.

644
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,680
别做像你爸那样的懦夫
Oh, don't tell me you're a fucking coward like your dad.

645
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
噢 噢 天啊
Oh, oh, my God.

646
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,850
我去拿些冰块来
I'll get some ice.

647
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,720
太疯狂了 我不知所措
I can't deal with this crazy right now.

648
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,150
我明天还有个医学院的面试
I got a med school interview tomorrow.

649
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,350
去看医生把
Uh, see a doctor.

650
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,860
- 抱歉 抱歉 - 伙计们
- I'm sorry. Sorry. - Guys!

651
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,060
听着 我们得到医院去 明白吗？走
Look, we got to go to the hospital, okay? Come on.

652
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,270
你敢相信所发生的的一切吗？
You believe all this?

653
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,440
我不知道该相信什么
I don't know what to believe.

654
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,240
快啊
Come on.

655
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,020
布莱德
Brad.

656
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,320
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

657
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
布莱德
Brad.

658
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,430
真心话
Truth!

659
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,810
布莱德？
Brad?

660
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,850
嗨
Hi.

661
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,180
- 你在这儿干什么？- 这是我的工作
- What are you doing here? - Uh, my job.

662
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,190
你怎么在这儿？
Why are you here?

663
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,290
我一个朋友受伤了 不严重
Friend of mine got hurt. It's nothing serious.

664
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,190
我是来安慰鼓励一下
I'm just here for... for moral support.

665
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,460
有什么问题吗？
Something wrong?

666
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,130
没 我只是有点紧张
Yeah, no, I'm just, uh... I'm just a little shaken up.

667
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,840
你几个星期都没来看望你妈妈了
You haven't come by to see your mother in a few weeks.

668
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,140
我知道 很抱歉
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

669
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,940
现在我仍然在给你付学费
I thought I was paying for this school

670
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
所以你应该经常回家看看
so you could come home every once in a while.

671
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,910
我知道 我知道 我只是...
I-I know, I know, I just...

672
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,180
只是因为近来碰到些奇怪的事情
Things have been a little crazy lately.

673
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,020
我不想听借口 儿子
You know, I don't want to hear excuses, son.

674
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,820
我想听真心话
I want the truth.

675
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,420
信用卡账单又多了几千美元
There goes another thousand dollars in credit card debt.

676
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,290
噢 天啊 利维
Oh, my God, Liv.

677
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,300
刚才轮到我了
I just had my turn.

678
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,160
- 你什么？- 就是那个游戏
- You what? - The game.

679
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,230
它让我站出来
It made me, um, it made me come out.

680
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,440
直面我爸
To my father.

681
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,780
你没事吧？
Wha... Are you okay?

682
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,910
没事
Yeah.

683
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,580
没事 没事
Yeah. Yeah.

684
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,950
人生中第一次 我对他说出了心里话
For the first time in my life, I... I told him my truth

685
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,480
我勇敢地面对他 那种感觉...
and I stood up to him, and I feel...

686
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
那种感觉非常爽
I feel awesome.

687
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,120
等等 你爸以前不知道你是基佬吗？
Okay, hold on, your dad didn't know that you were gay?

688
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,360
你的铃声可是碧昂丝的歌
Your ringtone's Beyoncé.

689
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,090
每个人都喜欢碧昂丝
Everyone loves Beyoncé.

690
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,030
下一个就该轮到泰森了
Tyson's next.

691
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,450
成了
Will do.

692
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,450
泰森·库兰？
Tyson Curran?

693
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,090
开始吧
Let's do this.

694
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,830
这边请
Right this way.

695
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,030
你是在医生世家长大的？
So, you come from a family of doctors, then?

696
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,470
是的 女士 我妈妈 爸爸 姐姐 叔叔和祖父都是医生
Yes, ma'am. Mother, father, sister, uncle and grandfather.

697
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,000
基本上一家子都是
Pretty much everybody.

698
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,500
他们给你树立了光辉榜样
Well, they must have set a great example

699
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,410
让你也想走同样的职业道路
for you to want to take the same route.

700
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,970
是的 完全正确 斯宾塞院长
Yes, uh, absolutely, Dean Spencer.

701
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
我成长过程中
You know, uh, growing up,

702
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,440
经常听到他们救死扶伤的故事
I would hear their stories about saving lives,

703
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,610
所以我想
and... I think...

704
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,520
我想这深深地影响了我
I think that somehow shaped me.

705
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,120
佩 泰森在哪儿？
Pen. Where's Tyson?

706
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,490
他在医学院面试 怎么了？
His med school interview. Why?

707
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,000
你知道...
You know...

708
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
我可以去做那些...
I could do something...

709
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,200
自利的工作 比如基金管理之类的
self-serving, like become a hedge fund manager.

710
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,210
但现实情况是 人民需要帮助 特别是在这种非常时期
The thing is, people need help, especially in times like these.

711
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,010
你品德真是高尚
That's very noble of you.

712
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,010
你知道...
You know...

713
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,420
我还有最后一个问题
I just have one final question.

714
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,960
还没轮到他
He hasn't had his turn yet.

715
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,400
库兰先生？
Mr. Curran?

716
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,170
别忘了你的包
Your bag.

717
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,400
- 等等 泰森 不 等等 泰森 - 嘿
- Wait, Tyson, no. Wait, Tyson! - Hey!

718
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,380
我能帮你什么吗？
Can I help you?

719
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,650
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

720
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,450
抱歉 能再说一次吗？
I'm sorry, I beg your pardon?

721
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,750
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

722
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,260
真心话吧
Truth, I guess.

723
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,230
我朋友让你这么做的吗？
Did my friends really put you up to this?

724
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,130
你给别人开假药方多久了？
How long have you been forging prescriptions?

725
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,970
我没开过
I don't.

726
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,440
她真这么跟你说的吗？
Did she actually tell you that?

727
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,540
- 什么？- 我没有开假药方
- Excuse me? - I don't forge prescriptions.

728
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,710
你为什么这么问我？
Why would you even ask me that?

729
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,010
嗯..
Um...

730
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,350
- 泰森 泰森 泰森 快开门 - 嘿 嘿 - 嘿 泰森
- Ty! Ty! Ty! Open the door! - Hey! Hey! - Hey, Tyson!

731
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,390
- 泰森 - 泰森 - 你没事吧？
- Tyson! - Tyson! - Are you okay?

732
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,090
- 开门 - 泰森 - 泰森 嘿
- Open the door! - Ty! - Ty! Hey!

733
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,250
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

734
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,360
噢 噢 天啊
Oh! Oh, my... Oh, my God!

735
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,690
噢 天啊
Oh, my God!

736
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,200
天啊
My God!

737
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,640
泰森撒谎了 所以他死了
Tyson lied and then died because of it.

738
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,210
就像罗尼没有完成大冒险 所以死了
Just like Ronnie did when he didn't do the dare.

739
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,210
下一个轮到我了
Then my turn's next.

740
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,420
选真心话吧
Yeah, pick truth.

741
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,820
听着 我们大家都选择真心话 明白吗？
I mean, listen, we-we all should, right?

742
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,450
不管它问什么问题
And then whatever question that we get asked,

743
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,050
咱们都百分之百真诚地回答
we just answer it with a hundred percent honesty.

744
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,620
懂吗？这样才能活下去
Okay? That's how we're gonna survive

745
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,360
直到最终我们破解了这个迷局
till we figure this out.

746
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,030
都明白了吗？只选择真心话
We got it? Only choose truth.

747
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,130
我还要些伏特加
Need more vodka.

748
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,570
你得睡会儿
You need sleep.

749
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,400
我扶她到床上去
Okay, I'll put her in bed.

750
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,210
你们去找卡特
You guys find Carter.

751
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,180
这游戏是他起头的 他可能知道该怎样结束
He started all this. Maybe he can end it.

752
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,090
他说自己上的是南加利福尼亚大学
He said that he went to USC.

753
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,420
搜出5个卡特 但没一个是咱们要找的
Five Carters, none of them our guy.

754
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,690
也许USC指的不是南加利福尼亚大学
Maybe he meant the other USC.

755
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,230
好了 她睡着了 你们找到卡特了吗？
All right, she's asleep. Did you find Carter yet?

756
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,230
- 没有任何眉目 - 你们试过谷歌吗？
- No. Dead end. - Did you try using Google?

757
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,240
搜索"墨西哥真心话还是大冒险"
Search "Mexico truth or dare."

758
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,580
伙计们？
Uh, guys?

759
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,550
"嫌疑人吉赛尔·哈蒙德 22岁 是一名美国大学生
"Suspect Giselle Hammond, 22, an American college student,

760
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,490
"她在罗萨里托海滩度春假时失踪
"had gone missing while on spring break in Rosarito Beach.

761
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:18,560
"店员讲述了哈蒙德在失踪前的奇怪举动
"The clerk recounted Hammond's bizarre behavior before the incident,

762

我不想再玩这游戏了
I don't want to play anymore.

765
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,740
有现金吗？
¿Va a ser cash o crédito?

766
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,270
大冒险
Dare.

抱歉
Perdón.

768
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,350
- 不要 - 抱歉 我别无选择
- No! - I'm sorry, I don't have a choice.

769
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,780
天啊
Holy shit.

770
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,950
- 抓到她了吗？- 呃
- Did they catch her? - Uh...

771
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,490
还没有 这上面说他们还在搜捕中
No, no, it says there's still an ongoing search.

772
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,460
我找到了她的脸书
I just found her on Facebook.

773
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,870
- 天啊 是他 - 他被标记了吗？
- Oh, my God, it's him. - Is he tagged?

00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,870
没有 其他照片中并没有看到他

看看留言板 也许他有发言
Look at her wall. Maybe he posted.

776
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,940
我没看到
Well, not that I see.

777
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,810
留言太多了
But... there's a bunch of posts

778
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,450
都是让她去自首的
about people asking her to turn herself in,stuff like that.

779
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,450
等等 你们觉得她会看这些留言吗？
Wait, do you think she's checking this?

780
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,980
- 给她发消息 - 等等
- DM her. - Wait.

781
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,920
先申请个小号
Just, uh, make a fake account.

782
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,290
- 不能让她追踪到我们 - 没错
- We don't want this shit traced to us. - Yeah.

783
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,230
这是我们第一次一块儿度假
So, we're here on our first vacation together.

784
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,870
- 是第一次吗？- 第一次到海滩
- Is it our first vacation together? Kinda? - The beach.

785
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:36,540
上次我们一起到德克萨斯去看望我父母过
Um, I mean, there was that time you came and visited me and my family in Texas,

786
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,500
- 但是 - 你是德克萨斯人？
- but... - You're from Texas?

787
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,510
我以为你是墨西哥人
I thought you were from Mexico.

788
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,510
我不是墨西哥人
I'm not from Mexico!

789
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,250
泰森
Tyson!

790
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,990
我们也在玩那个游戏
We're playing the game, too.

791
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,790
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

792
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,260
- 请跟我见个面吧 - 这女人正在被通缉
- Please meet me. - This woman is wanted for murder.

793
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:06,700
你真的认为她会因为一句"我们需要帮助"就现身吗？
Do you really think she's gonna come out of hiding for "We need your help"?

794
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,710
我知道大冒险迫使你把那个女人点着了
I know the game dared you to set that woman on fire.

795
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,510
告诉我到哪儿去见你
Tell me where to meet you,

796
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,750
否则我会到你家门外等着
or I'll wait outside your family's house

797
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,750
直到大冒险游戏让我把你家烧了
until the game dares me to do the same to them.

798
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,420
玛姬 你不能这么写
Markie, you cannot send that.

799
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,020
如果你想活命 就不要再管他人死活了
If you want to live, you need to stop thinking

800
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,260
好好为你自己想一想吧
about other people and start thinking about yourself.

801
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,420
真心话还是大冒险 美女？
Truth or dare, beautiful?

802
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,320
什么？没有泰森在
What? Hard to make a decision

803
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,590
你很难自己做出决定是吗？
without Tyson telling you what to do?

804
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,660
去你妈的
Screw you.

805
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,060
真心话
Truth.

806
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,930
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

807
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,800
我说了 真心话
I said truth.

808
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,670
抱歉
Sorry.

809
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,540
游戏不是这样玩的
That's not how this game works.

810
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,640
你这是什么意思？
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

811
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,340
耐心点 她会回复的
Be patient. She'll write back.

812
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,880
这一切都是我的错
This is all my fault.

813
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,820
- 嘿 不 不是你的错 - 不 的确是她的错
- Hey, no, it's not. - No, she's right.

814
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,720
我们都不想跟着那个怪胎走
None of us wanted to follow that creep.

815
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,990
也都不想玩那个蠢游戏
None of us wanted to play that stupid game.

816
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:39,460
我之所以去那儿旅行全是因为你
The only reason I went on that trip was for you.

817
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,760
- 忘了吗？你说你需要最好的朋友一起去 - 好了 别说了
- Remember? You said you needed your best friend. - All right, come on...

818
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,600
我还没说完 我现在知道了 这和友谊无关
No, but now I realize it's not about friendship

819
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,870
也和那句"我会选择你"无关  你让我去就是想
or "I choose you," it was about me being there

820
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,870
在你和陌生人乱搞的时候帮你打掩护
to cover your ass while you hooked up with randoms!

821
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,570
嘿
Hey.

822
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,480
去你娘的 奥利维亚
Screw you, Olivia.

823
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,450
有必要这样吗？
Was that necessary?

824
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,480
伙计们 快出来看看
Guys. Come outside.

825
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,020
快
Now!

826
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,990
不好
Shit.

827
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,590
佩？你在干什么？
Pen? What are you doing?

828
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,030
我试过了 它不让我选真心话
I tried. It wouldn't let me pick truth.

829
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,930
我发誓 我试过了
I tried, I swear!

830
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,430
我喝完这瓶酒之前 必须踩着边缘走
I have to walk the edge until I finish this.

831
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,540
佩 你不会有事的
Pen, you're gonna be fine.

832
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,680
慢着点 别急
Okay, just go slow. Take your time.

833
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,650
- 当心点 - 我马上上去
- Oh! - Be careful! - I'm gonna go up there.

834
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,980
她失去平衡的时候 我会努力抓住她
I'll try and grab her if she loses her balance.

835
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,750
你手伤了 还是我去吧
No, your hand's broken. I'll go.

836
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,750
佩 慢点走 明白吗？
Pen, just walk slowly, okay?

837
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,020
嘿
Hey!

838
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,120
千万别急 明白吗？慢慢走
Just take your time, okay? Walk slowly.

839
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,560
不会有事的
It's gonna be fine.

840
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,660
- 我们怎么办？- 小心点
- What do we do? - Be careful.

841
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,860
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

842
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,600
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

843
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,770
我们得去拿个东西过来垫着 以防她摔下来
We need to grab something in case she falls. Go inside.

844
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,500
- 我来清出一条道来 - 好 咱们走 快
- I'm gonna clear a path. - All right, let's go, let's go,

845
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
快 快
let's go, let's go!

846
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:07,980
佩 当心点
Pen? Be careful.

847
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,650
- 你能行的 明白吗？- 嘿 这能行么？
- You're good, okay? - Hey, will this work?

848
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,120
什么？可以 可以 快
What? Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

849
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,860
放在她正下方
Just get under her.

850
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,020
- 放在正下方跟着她 - 当心点 佩
- Get under her and follow her. - Be careful, Pen.

851
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,690
- 噢 嘘...- 退后 退后 退后
- Oh, sh... - Get back. Get back, get back.

852
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,630
别急
No need to rush.

853
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,570
没事的 没事的 佩
It's okay. It's okay, Pen.

854
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,740
慢慢来 慢慢来
Just take your time. Take it slowly.

855
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,810
佩 把一只脚放在另一只脚的前面
Pen, just put one foot in front of the other.

856
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,680
小心点 好吗？慢点走
Watch it, okay? Just go slow.

857
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,550
你能做到
You can do this.

858
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,890
我们都在这儿支持你 明白吗？
We're right here. We're here for you, okay?

859
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,760
我看到她了 就在那儿
I see her. She's right there.

860
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,170
快 快 快
Go. Go. Go.

861
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:01,270
- 等等 她在转角处了 - 她在那儿
- W-Wait, she's on the corner. - There she is.

862
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,900
把那东西挪开
Get that stuff out of the way.

863
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,920
佩 佩
Pen! Pen.

864
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,250
我来了 我来了
I'm coming. I'm coming.

865
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,720
不 不 不 别靠太近
No, no, no, don't get too close.

866
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,990
如果我半途而废 没有完成大冒险...
If I, if I, if I cheat, if I don't do the dare...

867
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,530
我知道 我知道 好
I know. I know. Okay?

868
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,790
等你喝完了 我会抓住你的
But when you finish, I'll be here to grab you.

869
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,670
现在你得绕过这个转角 懂吗？
Just got to go around this corner now, okay?

870
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,780
噢
Oh.

871
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,750
快
Come on.

872
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,790
慢着点
Take your time, okay?

873
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,590
你做得很好 佩
You're doing great, Pen.

874
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,830
- 别往下看 - 等等  停这儿 停在她下方
- Don't look down. - Wait. Stay here. Stay below her.

875
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,130
等等 你到哪儿去？
Okay. Wait, where are you going?

876
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,160
嘿 佩 别看栅栏
Hey, Pen. Don't look at the fence.

877
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,670
看着我 好吗？你就要成功了
Okay? Look at me. Okay? You're almost there.

878
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,840
还差一点点
Just a little more.

879
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,750
她就在我们头上 扔到上面去
She's right above us. Throw it on top.

880
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,780
- 你准备好了吗？- 好了
- You ready? - Yeah.

881
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,090
这样不行
That's not gonna work.

882
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,360
那样也许可行
That might.

883
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,040
嘿 佩内洛普
- Whoa! - Hey! Penelope!

884
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,270
妈的
Shit.

885
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,810
伙计们 再往后退点
Guys, get back further!

886
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,380
- 快 快 快 退后 - 退后
- Go, go, go, move back. - Get back!

887
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,180
最后一小口
One last sip.

888
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,900
不 不 佩 嘿 佩 不 不
No, no, Pen! Hey, Pen! No! No!

889
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,230
- 佩？- 她没反应
- Pen? - She's not moving.

890
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
佩？
Pen?

891
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,880
这是我的床么？
Is this my bed?

892
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,290
是
Yeah.

893
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,860
你没事了
You're okay.

894
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,230
我收到一条吉赛尔发来的回复
I just got a Facebook message from Giselle.

895
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,350
来这地方见她真是个好主意吗？
We're sure this is a good idea, meeting her here?

896
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,750
如果警察追踪了她的消息怎么办？
What if the cops trace her message?

897
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,150
不可能 她用小号发给我们的
No, she wrote us on a fake account.

898
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,150
没错 但这女的可是点火烧过人的
Yeah, but that chick lit somebody on fire.

899
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,020
- 她也许是个疯子 - 我意思是
- She's probably nuts. - I mean,

900
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,390
难道没有别的选择吗？
do we really have another choice?

901
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,730
咱们到里面谈吧
I mean, we can talk about this inside. Come on.

902
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,240
走
Let's go.

903
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,400
里面？
Inside?

904
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,440
好了 行了 这够里面了
Uh-uh. Okay, all right, that's far enough.

905
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,080
你能说说到底是怎么回事吗？
Can you tell us what's happening?

906
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,340
- 你们中谁是奥利维亚？- 不 你先回答我们的问题
- Which one of you is Olivia? - No, you answer

907
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,010
第一：你怎么认识卡特的？
our question first: How do you know Carter?

908
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,350
- 卡特？- 别想骗我们
- Carter? - You know, cut the crap.

909
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,310
我们见过那张照片
We saw the photo.

910
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,850
是他带我们进游戏的
He's the one who brought us into this game.

911
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:38,920
哦 对 没错 我想起来了
Uh, yeah, right, okay.

912
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,350
- 是叫卡特 没错 - 你也是被他带进游戏的吗？
- Carter, right. - Did he bring you into this, too?

913
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,220
不 不是他起头的
N-No, uh, he didn't, he didn't start this.

914
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,460
他只是我的一个朋友
He was just one of my friends.

915
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,930
我们到墨西哥去游玩 喝得烂醉
We-we all went on a trip to Mexico and got really wasted.

916
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,000
我们发现了一个老教堂 在里面开了个派对
We-we found this old church, and we decided to party in it,

917
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,170
后来我室友提议玩真心话大冒险 大家就开始了
and my roommate wanted to play Truth or Dare, so we did,

918
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,400
但是等我们回来之后 游戏却仍然在继续
but when we got home, the game, it just, it kept going.

919
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,170
我室友第一个死的 然后其他人..
My roommate died first, and then the other ones...

920
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,110
- 这怎么可能呢？- 我也想知道
- How is this possible? - I wish I knew.

921
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,040
我想 这可能是
You know, I thought this was some kind of, like,

922
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,010
萨姆破坏那地方招来的报应吧
karmic payback for Sam trashing the place, you know?

923
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,150
- 萨姆？- 对 萨姆
- Sam? - Uh, yeah, Sam.

924
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,010
他是我的一个朋友
He-he was... one of my friends.

925
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,180
他当时喝得大醉 乱搞破坏
He-he got really drunk, and he just started breaking stuff.

926
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,820
很难说得清楚 我们当时都像傻子一样
I don't know, we were, we were all being idiots.

927
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,890
我们一个朋友 刚才轮到了她
Our friend just had a turn in the game.

928
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,360
但她却没法选择真心话 你知道原因么？
It wouldn't let her pick truth. Do you know why?

929
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,790
这是我们的玩法
It's how we played.

930
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,460
两次真心话连着一次大冒险
We called it two truths and a dare.

931
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,460
如果连续两人选择了真心话
If... if two people picked truth in a row,

932
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,430
接下来的那一个就必须选择大冒险
then the next person had to do a dare.

933
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,470
我们觉得这样会更有趣
Thought it was more fun that way.

934
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,270
更有趣？你那个混蛋朋友给我们判了死刑
More fun? Your asshole buddy gave us a death sentence.

935
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,070
还有什么更危险的规则瞒着我们吗？
Any more super dangerous rules you want to tell us about?

936
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,310
冷静点 佩
Easy, Pen.

937
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,880
他告诉我 大冒险游戏让他找一帮新人进来玩
He-he told me he was dared to find a new group to play,

938
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,480
而且必须是在教堂
and that it had to be at the mission.

939
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,150
他别无选择 你们知道吗？
He didn't have a choice, you know?

940
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,980
他当然可以选择
Of course he did.

941
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,980
好了 卡特现在在哪儿？
Okay, so where is Carter now?

942
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,890
自从墨西哥回来后 我就没再和他联系过
I haven't talked to him since he went back to Mexico.

943
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,850
我本以为他找到新的一群人加入游戏后
I thought that when he got a new group to play

944
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:52,220
我们就可以退出了  没想到他只找到你们5个人
that we-we would be out. I can't believe he only got five of you to play.

945
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,190
如果人再多点
If he would've got more,

946
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,160
我就有更长的时间准备下一轮了
then I would've had a longer time before I had to go again.

947
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,430
你还有一轮？
You got another turn?

948
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,470
好了 该走了 伙计们
Okay, it's time to go, guys.

949
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,040
这就是你对我们说真心话的原因？
Is this why you're telling us the truth?

950
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,240
不 我...我选的是大冒险
No, I, uh... I picked dare.

951
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,070
玛姬说得对 咱们离开这儿
Markie's right. Let's get out of here.

952
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,110
咱们走 快 奥利维亚
Okay, we're leaving. Come on, Olivia.

953
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,880
很抱歉 奥利维亚
I am so sorry, Olivia.

954
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,450
我们一到这儿 你怎么就知道有一个叫奥利维亚的？
How did you know my name when I got here?

955
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,020
我并没有在信息中透露我的名字
I... I didn't put it in the message.

956
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,820
不 不
No! No!

957
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,190
- 不 佩！- 佩！
- No! Pen! - Pen!

958
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,930
不 不
No! No!

959
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,330
- 压住她 - 我必须杀了奥利维亚
- Hold her down! - I have to kill Olivia!

960
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,300
压住她
Hold her down!

961
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,240
抓住枪
Grab the gun.

962
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,840
别动
Stop moving.

963
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,510
这是要干什么？
What the...?

964
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,110
什么？不 不
What? No! No!

965
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:48,080
不 不 不
No! No! No!

966
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,450
妈的
Oh, shit.

967
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,960
她是怎么想的？
What was she thinking?

968
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,190
不是她的原因
It wasn't her.

969
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
她的身体被某种东西控制了
Something took over, like she was possessed.

970
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,100
她没有完成大冒险
She didn't finish her dare.

971
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,270
就像罗尼那样
Like Ronnie.

972
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,540
这就是原因
This is what happens.

973
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,470
那我们怎么办？
So what do we do?

974
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,010
我们说真心话
We tell the truth.

975
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,150
她当时很奇怪
She was erratic,

976
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,560
她说她必须杀了我
said she had to kill me.

977
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,560
然后佩内洛普把我推开了
Then Penelope pushed me out of the way,

978
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,430
她打中了她 然后开枪自杀
she shot her and then turned the gun on herself.

979
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,630
你当时知不知道吉赛尔·哈蒙德是通缉犯？
Were you aware that Giselle Hammond was wanted for murder?

980
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:39,200
知道 知道 但我们以为她认识
Yes. Yeah, we thought that she knew someone

981
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,470
我们正在找的一个在墨西哥遇到的人
that we were looking for, a guy that we met in Mexico.

982
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,470
- 他叫卡特 - 你不知道他姓什么？
- His name was Carter. - You don't know his last name?

983
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,240
不知道
No.

984
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,980
这些人里面有像他的吗？
Any of these people look like him?

985
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,320
没有 他们是谁？
No. Who are they?

986
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,460
吉赛尔·哈蒙德的五个朋友 全都已经死了
Five of Giselle Hammond's friends... all deceased.

987
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,160
三个自杀 两个意外身亡 全都发生在三周内
Three suicides, two accidental deaths, all in three weeks.

988
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,400
现在你已经失去了两个朋友
And now you've lost two friends.

989
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,400
我不相信这是巧合 奥利维亚
I don't believe in coincidences, Olivia.

990
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,070
所有这些都应该是相关联的
I think this is all connected.

991
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:17,140
如果你知道原因 一定要告诉我
If you know how, you need to tell me.

992
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,310
我不知道 我保证
No, I promise.

993
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,940
如果我知道 我一定会说的
If I did know, I would.

994
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,250
希望如此
I hope so.

995
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,320
我们保持联系
We'll be in touch.

996
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,420
不要再去旅行
Don't take any more vacations.

997
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,990
事情进展不利
That did not go well.

998
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,260
我们把所知道的都告诉他们了
We told them the truth as much as we could.

999
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,100
伙计们 我们不能指望警察解决这问题
Guys, the cops should be the least of our concerns.

1000
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,640
我意思是 佩内洛普死了 吉赛尔什么忙也没帮到
I mean, Penelope's dead and Giselle gave us nothing.

1001
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,640
她说了新的一轮游戏必须从教堂开始
She did say a new game had to start at the mission.

1002
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,640
因此那地方才是关键所在
That place has to be the key.

1003
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,580
布莱德
Brad.

1004
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,750
我待会儿再来找你们
Catch up with you guys later.

1005
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,280
- 不 咱们最好别分开 - 没事的
- No, we shouldn't split up. - No, it's okay.

1006
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,550
没那么快轮到我
My turn's not for a while.

1007
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:06,120
我先说服我爸 你们去找那个教堂
I'll deal with my father; you deal with finding the mission.

1008
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,060
快
Come on.

1009
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,660
教堂是在1896年建成的
I think it was built in 1896.

1010
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,330
这大大缩小了搜索范围
Yeah, that really narrows it down.

1011
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,530
这只是个开头
It's a start.

1012
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,070
噢 不好 我得去拿充电器
Oh, shit. I got to grab my charger.

1013
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,010
你把包落在我房间里了
Uh, I think you left your bag in my room.

1014
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,300
- 噢 天啊 - 什么？
- Oh, my God. - What?

1015
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,680
看看这个
Check this out.

1016
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:06,110
这上面说 几周后 那里发生了一次屠杀
It says there was a massacre a few weeks later.

1017
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:10,320
只有一个生还者 她叫伊内兹·雷耶斯 当时19岁
Only one survivor, lives in the area, Inez Reyes, 19.

1018
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:55,400
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

1019
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:08,740
她在哪儿？利维
Where is she? Liv!

1020
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,410
- 嘿 嘿 - 奥利维亚
- Hey! Hey! - - Olivia.

1021
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,480
- 你没事吧？- 我这是在哪儿？
- Are you okay? - Where am I?

1022
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,350
- 我在哪儿？- 你他妈在搞什么？
- Where am I?! - What the hell are you...?

1023
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,280
你是谁...嘿 嘿 嘿
Who the... Hey, hey, hey!

1024
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,650
嘿
Hey!

1025
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,650
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1026
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,520
刚才轮到你了是吗？
Was that your turn?

1027
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,490
嘿 嘿 回来
Hey, hey, come back!

1028
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,330
回来
Come back!

1029
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,460
奥利维亚 他说什么了？
Olivia, what did he say?

1030
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,840
他让我去和卢卡斯睡一觉
He dared me to sleep with Lucas.

1031
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,280
你为什么选择大冒险？
Why would you pick dare?

1032
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,280
因为吉赛尔说过
Because of what Giselle said.

1033
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,780
如果我选了真心话
I-If I picked truth,

1034
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,750
那接下来的某人就得选择大冒险
I was just forcing someone else to pick dare.

1035
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,390
你真高尚！
How noble.

1036
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:00,230
玛姬 我事前并不知道它会要求怎么做
Markie, I didn't know that's what it would ask.

1037
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,790
我想刚那人并不清楚自己怎么会在那屋里的
I don't think he knew where he was.

1038
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,630
- 你们还好吗？- 当然 好极了
- Are you guys okay? - Yeah, I'm perfect.

1039
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,330
嘿 嘿 你要去哪儿？
Well, hey, hey. Where are you going?

1040
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,670
- 除了这里 哪儿都可以 - 这是怎么了？
- Anywhere but here. - What is going on?

1041
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:11,310
你为什么不问问奥利维亚？
Why don't you ask Olivia?

1042
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:21,150
能告诉我发生了什么事吗？
Will you please tell me what the hell is going on?

1043
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,790
刚轮到我了
I got my turn.

1044
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,490
然后呢？
Yeah, and?

1045
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,200
噢 嘿 不 我们要干什么？
Mm, oh, hey, no. Wh-What are we doing?

1046
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,770
这就是大冒险的要求
Oh, this is the dare.

1047
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,680
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1048
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,610
你为什么不选真心话？
Why didn't you pick truth?

1049
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,620
我对玛姬说 我选了大冒险 你们以后就可以不选
I told Markie it was so that you guys wouldn't have to,

1050
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,780
但这不是我的真实想法
but that was a lie.

1051
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,620
我选择大冒险 是因为
I chose dare because there is something

1052
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,250
有些事我永远不能让玛姬知道
that I can never tell Markie,

1053
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,720
我很担心这个游戏会迫使我说出来
and I'm really afraid the game's gonna make me do it.

1054
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:04,890
没那么糟的
It can't be that bad.

1055
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,330
你不明白
You have no idea.

1056
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,680
什么？
What?

1057
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,450
你要和我做这事儿是因为大冒险逼得
No, you are just doing this because of the dare,

1058
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:28,750
你不得不做
because you have to.

1059
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,650
不对 是你不得不做
No, you have to.

1060
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,320
我没必要
I don't.

1061
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,730
看着我
Look at me.

1062
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,900
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

1063
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:21,030
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

1064
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,770
真心话
Tr-Truth!

1065
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:25,040
你真正爱的是谁？
Who are you truly in love with?

1066
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,480
我在乎你 真的在乎
I care about you. I do.

1067
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,890
但我爱玛姬
I'm in love with Markie.

1068
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:45,590
利维 抱歉 刚才是游戏中所言
Liv, I'm sorry. It was the game.

1069
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:48,700
不 你说的是真心话
No, it was the truth.

1070
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,760
罗伊·卡梅伦 45岁
Roy Cameron, 45 years old,

1071
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,660
现在想做晚餐
attempts to make dinner.

1072
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,430
看一看
Take one.

1073
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,530
对我有点信心吧
Whoa, a little faith, please.

1074
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,600
没人像你老爸这样做牛排的
Nobody makes a steak like your old man.

1075
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,970
等等 爸 我现在很悲观
Wait, Dad, I'm pescatarian now.

1076
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:31,770
我知道 亲爱的
I know, honey.

1077
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,380
爸？
Dad?

1078
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,750
我很想你
I miss you so much.

1079
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,650
我也想你
I miss you, too.

1080
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,990
我一直很想问你件事
There's something that I've been dying to ask you.

1081
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,760
不
No.

1082
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,160
她不接电话
She's not answering.

1083
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,630
等等 过来 看这儿
Wait. Come here. Look at this.

1084
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,570
没有号码 但她住在蒂华纳
There's no number, but she lives in Tijuana.

1085
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:01,900
离这儿不到3小时车程
That's less than three hours away.

1086
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,770
她是谁？
Who is she?

1087
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,770
她也许可以帮到我们
She's someone who might be able to help us.

1088
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,440
快
Come on.

1089
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,980
快 宝贝
Come on, sweetheart.

1090
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,420
是时候做出选择了
Time to pick.

1091
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,950
真心话
Truth.

1092
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,560
那把我用来自杀的枪...
The gun I used to kill myself...

1093
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,490
你为什么还保留着？
why do you keep it?

1094
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,900
因为有时候 我也想要使用它
Sometimes I think about using it.

1095
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,000
也许你该去把它拿来
Maybe you should get it.

1096
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,040
我担心玛姬
I'm worried about Markie.

1097
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,810
我希望在离开之前找到她
I wish we would have found her before we left.

1098
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,510
可她现在不想和我说话
Yeah, well, she doesn't want to speak to me right now,

1099
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,450
我们什么也做不了
so there's nothing we can do.

1100
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,850
你有个不想让她知道的那个秘密对吗？
You know that secret that you're keeping from her?

1101
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,560
你不如干脆把它说出来
Maybe if you got it out,

1102
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,690
- 这样那游戏就不能用它来威胁你了 - 不行
- the game couldn't use it against you. - No.

1103
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,590
谁也不准知道那个秘密
No one can ever know.

1104
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,660
特别是玛姬 知道后她可能会受不了的
Especially not Markie. It would kill her.

1105
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:06,900
到目的地后 我再打一次电话给她
I'll try her again when we get there.

1106
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,210
有什么事吗？
- Um... - Can I help you?

1107
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,910
打扰了 我们是来找伊内兹·雷耶斯的
S-Sorry. Um, we're looking for Inez Reyes.

1108
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,980
她是我奶奶 我负责照看她
She's my grandmother. I watch after her.

1109
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,150
我们能和她聊会儿么
We were just wondering if we could speak to her.

1110
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,520
她和谁都不说话
She speaks to no one.

1111
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,590
不 求求你
No. Please!

1112
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:04,590
我的朋友们正在一个个死去 她也有过这种经历
Our friends are dying just like hers did.

1113
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,200
所以我们想从她那儿得到些帮助
We-we just need a few words.

1114
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,800
我去问问她
I will ask.

1115
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:15,870
可以的话 你把这个给她
And if you could... show her this.

1116
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,600
告诉她 我们曾到这个教堂去过
Show her that we were at this mission

1117
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:21,870
而这张照片里的一半人已经死了
and that half the people in this photo are now dead.

1118
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,640
这样也许她会答应和我们聊聊
Then maybe she'll talk to us.

1119
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:29,280
她可能会见你们 但她不会开口的
She might see you, but she will not speak to you.

1120
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,080
她已经50年没说过话了
She has not said a word in 50 years.

1121
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,560
稍等
Wait here.

1122
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:41,190
她一定发过誓要永远保持沉默 对吗？
She must have taken a vow of silence, right?

1123
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,030
她朋友们死的时候 她才19岁
She was 19 when her friends were butchered.

1124
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:46,230
- 想想看对她的伤害有多大 - 不用想都知道
- Imagine what that did to her. - I don't have to.

1125
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,860
已经过去一小时了
It's been over an hour.

1126
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,160
对于一个不说话的人来说
Yeah, for someone who doesn't speak,

1127
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,360
这么久时间她们一定聊了很多
they seem to be doing a lot of talking.

1128
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,670
她答应见你们了
She will see you.

1129
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,840
抱歉久等了
I'm sorry for the wait.

1130
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,270
她写了些东西给你们
She has written something for you.

1131
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:29,040
是什么？
What is it?

1132
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,840
她不准我看
She would not let me read it.

1133
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,560
谢谢你愿意见我们 雷耶斯女士
Thank you for seeing us, Miss Reyes.

1134
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,670
"那座教堂是个女修道院
"The mission was a convent

1135
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,270
"年轻女人到那儿去聆听上帝教诲
"where young women went to find God.

1136
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,850
"因为我们当时都很年轻 所以玩起了捉迷藏
"We were girls, so we played silly games like Hide and Seek.

1137
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,850
"但那座修道院的神父
"But the priest who ran the convent

1138
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,980
"强迫我们玩他发明的游戏
"forced us to play his own game.

1139
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,820
"他让我们都藏起来 然后惩罚那个被他找到的
"He let us hide, but then he took the one he found.

1140
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,360
"他的快乐建立在我们的痛苦上
"His pleasure was our pain.

1141
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,820
"我们只能默默忍受
"We suffered in silence.

1142
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,260
"后来 我们当中有个女孩说出了一个秘密
"Then one of the girls told a secret.

1143
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:24,230
"她通晓咒语 可以召唤恶魔
"She knew spells that could call spirits,

1144
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:27,370
"所以她召来一个叫加勒克斯的恶魔
"so she summoned a demon named Calux.

1145
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,140
从那以后 他支配了我们的游戏"
He possessed our game."

1146
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,710
支配了那个游戏？
Possessed the game?

1147
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,820
"恶魔支配人体 支配地方
"Demons possess people, places,

1148
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:49,120
支配物体 甚至支配思想"
objects, even ideas."

1149
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,230
"加勒克斯是个骗子
"Calux is a trickster.

1150
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:56,290
"那天晚上 当神父找到一个女孩后
"That night, when the priest found his victim,

1151
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,460
"恶魔早已经侵入并控制了那女孩
"she was possessed by Calux.

1152
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:03,070
"她把神父碎尸后藏在了教堂里...
"She hid the priest's body in the mission...in pieces.

1153
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:05,940
"她们花了一个星期才找到他的头
"It took them a week to find his head.

1154
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,110
"但加勒克斯并不想就此罢手
"But Calux didn't want to stop.

1155
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,080
"他让我们继续玩那个游戏
"He made us keep playing.

1156
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,980
许多姐妹都因此丧命"
Many of my sisters died."

1157
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:19,660
那你和其他人是怎么逃脱的呢？
Wait, how did you and the others escape?

1158
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:36,470
"那个把恶魔召来的人
"The person who released the demon

1159
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:38,340
"用一套简单的仪式就可降服他
"can trap it with a simple ritual,

1160
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,380
"但必须是那人亲自动手"
but only by his own hand."

1161
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,210
这就是那道咒语？西班牙语写的
Uh, this is the spell? Uh, it's in Spanish.

1162
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,980
"必须重复七次咒语
"The spell must be repeated seven times

1163
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:54,360
"再把祭祀品放在一个罐子里 用蜡封紧
"and a sacrifice must be placed in a pot sealed with wax.

1164
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,960
"只要罐子密封着 放在教堂里
"As long as the pot stays sealed in the mission,

1165
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:09,940
通往阳间的门就对加勒克斯关闭着"
the door we opened for Calux will also be sealed."

1166
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,480
等等 我见过那个罐子
Wait, I've seen that pot before.

1167
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,280
你看
Yeah. Look.

1168
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,280
但我看到它的时候 已经破了
But when I saw it, it was broken

1169
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,050
里面有东西 但已经腐烂了
and there was something inside it and it smelled rotten.

1170
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:51,110
"谁打破的罐子 谁同样必须那么做"
"Whoever broke the pot will have to do the same."

1171
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,350
祭祀品到底是什么？
What was it? The sacrifice.

1172
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,330
是你把恶魔召来的？
It was you who summoned the demon?

1173
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,050
这是老西班牙语
It's been a few years since AP Spanish,

1174
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,460
我想大概意思是 "是我召来了恶魔
but I think it says, "I have called upon an evil.

1175
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:42,560
我愿以沉默为代价 让恶魔永远消失"
Silence my voice, so the evil is no more."

1176
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,130
所以卡特和他朋友们把教堂里那个罐子打破后
So when Carter and his friends broke the pot at the mission...

1177
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:46,070
恶魔就被释放了
The demon was freed

1178
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,600
进而支配了他们的真心话大冒险游戏
and possessed their game of Truth or Dare.

1179
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
我们必须找到打破罐子的那人
And we have to find whoever broke that pot.

1180
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,970
吉赛尔说过是一个叫萨姆的人破坏了教堂
But Giselle said somebody named Sam trashed the place.

1181
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:54,240
但我们根本不知道萨姆是谁
And we have no idea who Sam is.

1182
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,480
- 也不知道他还活着与否 - 就算我们真的找到了他...
- Or if he's even still alive. - And if we do find him...

1183
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,040
然后怎么办？对他说
What?

1184
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:01,280
"你好 萨姆 你介意把自己的舌头割下来
"Hi, Sam. Do you mind cutting out your tongue

1185
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,150
放到这个可爱的罐子里封紧吗？
and sealing it in this lovely handmade pot?"

1186
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,320
我再看看吉赛尔的脸书
I'll check Giselle's Facebook again,

1187
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,060
看看有没有标记萨姆的照片
see if there's a Sam tagged.

1188
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,560
还没有玛姬的消息吗？
Still nothing from Markie?

1189
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,390
她没有回复我发的任何一条短信
She's ignoring all my texts.

1190
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:15,660
接下来就该轮到她了
Her turn's next.

1191
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,360
我再给她打一次电话
I'm gonna try calling her again.

1192
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:22,130
布莱德？布莱德
Brad? Brad!

1193
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,000
我是你爸
It's your father.

1194
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:27,370
自从佩内洛普的事发生后 他一直...
Since Penelope, he's been...

1195
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,610
我去打发他走
I'll get rid of him.

1196
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,850
咱们外面聊
Let's talk outside.

1197
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,690
我去拿杯咖啡
I'm gonna grab coffee.

1198
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,100
我听到些传闻
Look, uh, I'm hearing some things

1199
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,100
关于你朋友的凶杀案的
about your, uh, friend's murder.

1200
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,270
刑事科克拉维斯觉得事情没那么简单
Kranis in Homicide isn't convinced it's so simple.

1201
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,240
我知道我没必要问这些 但
I know I don't need to ask this, but...

1202
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,240
你是不是还有什么秘密瞒着我？
is there something you're not telling us?

1203
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,640
没有 我保证
No, I-I promise.

1204
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,410
我们跟你说的都是真的
Everything we told you was true.

1205
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,450
玛姬 谢天谢地
Markie, thank God.

1206
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:13,990
你为什么要跟我说这些？
Why are you telling me all this?

1207
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,390
因为我知道克拉维斯是错的
'Cause I know Kranis is wrong,

1208
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,320
我也希望你知道事情真相
and I want you to know what's going on.

1209
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,560
听着 你不必担心
Look, you don't have to worry.

1210
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,130
我不会让你有事的
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

1211
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,500
你始终是我儿子 布莱德
You're still my son, Brad.

1212
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:34,470
- 你不回话吗？- 回什么话？
- You gonna get that? - Get what?

1213
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,980
真心话还是大冒险 布莱德？
Truth or dare, Brad?

1214
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,710
我需要些时间独处
Yeah, I guess I just needed some time alone.

1215
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,050
不 不 不 没事的
No, no, no. It's-it's fine.

1216
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,450
你必须尽可能快地赶过来
Just get here as fast as you can.

1217
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:44,450
千万要小心 下一个就轮到你了
And please be careful. Your turn's next.

1218
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:47,320
我已经轮到了 我选择了真心话
I had my turn. I chose truth.

1219
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,390
卢卡斯也选的真心话
So did Lucas.

1220
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:52,360
如果你俩都选了真心话
And if the both of you picked truth...

1221
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,360
你只有一个选择
You only have one choice.

1222
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,030
你确定没有什么要对我说吗？
You sure there's nothing you need to tell me?

1223
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:58,730
你去偷他的枪
I dare you to steal his gun

1224
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,730
让他求你饶命
and make him beg for his life.

1225
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,370
儿子？
Son?

1226
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:07,710
谢谢你做的一切 爸爸
Thank you, Dad, for everything.

1227
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,340
但我还有件事要做
It's just, uh, there's just one more thing I need to do,

1228
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,210
我希望你过后能原谅我
and I hope you can forgive me.

1229
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:16,210
当然 当然 没问题
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1230
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,720
原谅什么？
For what?

1231
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:26,060
没事的
It's okay.

1232
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,460
你得求我饶你一命
I need you to beg. For your life.

1233
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:33,600
- 你这是干什么？- 求我饶你一命
- The hell are you doing? - Beg for your life!

1234
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,770
布莱德 快放下枪
Brad, please, put the gun down!

1235
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,770
- 快按我说的做 不然我就死定了 - 你没必要这么做
- Just do as I say or I'll die. - You don't have to do this!

1236
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,340
- 跪下 - 我们得马上赶过去
- Get on your knees. - We have to go. Now!

1237
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,210
先按我说的做 过后我再解释 明白吗？
Do as I say. I'll explain everything, okay?

1238
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:43,440
- 我知道我平时对你过于严厉 - 听着 不
- I know I've been hard on you. - Listen. No!

1239
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,440
- 我很抱歉 - 不是这样
- And I'm sorry. - No.

1240
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,580
这都不是原因
That's not what this is about.

1241
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,450
求你了 快求我饶命 过后我再跟你解释
Beg! Please. I'll explain everything.

1242
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,220
- 快求我 - 你觉得我是咎由自取
- Just beg. - I guess you think I deserve this.

1243
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,750
不是 不是
No. No.

1244
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,430
求我 求我 求我就行了
Just, just, just, just beg!

1245
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,200
求求你 快求我 然后我就会放下枪
Please! Just beg and I'll put down the gun.

1246
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,630
- 那样有什么意义 布莱德？- 求我就是了
- What's that gonna prove, Brad? - Just beg,

1247
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:09,100
我会放下枪的 求我
and I'll put down the gun! Beg!

1248
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:14,140
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no!

1249
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,510
- 不 不 - 布莱德
- No! No! - Brad!

1250
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:18,610
布莱德 不 不 不 不
Brad! No, no, no! No!

1251
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,780
不 不
No! No!

1252
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,580
快叫急救员来
Get a paramedic!

1253
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,380
快啊
Come on.

1254
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,750
布莱德 布莱德 不要 不要 不要
Brad, Brad! No, no, no.

1255
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,550
坚持住 你会没事的
Stay here. You're gonna be fine.

1256
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,660
不 不
No! No!

1257
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,760
快叫急救员来 救救我儿子
I need a paramedic! Help!

1258
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,460
快叫急救员来 布莱德
I need a paramedic! Brad!

1259
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,770
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1260
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:54,680
伙计们 我们能走了吗？
Guys, can we get out of here?

1261
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,820
我还得和警官谈谈
I still need to talk to the detective.

1262
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,580
我不应该选真心话的
I shouldn't have picked truth.

1263
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:00,250
不 这不是你的错
No, it's not your fault.

1264
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,390
我也选了真心话
I picked truth, too.

1265
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,590
我们不该和布莱德分开的
We shouldn't have left Brad alone.

1266
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,730
不 这不是关键点
No, it wouldn't have mattered.

1267
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,560
这游戏太狡诈
This game is smart. It's too smart.

1268
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,560
不是我们在玩游戏 是它在玩我们
We're not playing it; it's playing us.

1269
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,400
我们的遭遇都不是偶然的
And none of this is a coincidence.

1270
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,200
它总是在等待我们最脆弱的时候
It waits for our most vulnerable moments,

1271
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,530
突然向我们发问
and that's when it asks us.

1272
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,440
没错 你说得对 奥利维亚
Yeah, you got that right, Olivia.

1273
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,380
现在轮到你了
And now it's your turn.

1274
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,210
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

1275
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,280
什么？
What?

1276
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,650
怎么了？
What is it?

1277
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:35,850
卢卡斯刚问我了
Lucas just asked me.

1278
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,620
不 我没有
No, I didn't.

1279
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:38,760
真心话还是大冒险 奥利维亚？
Truth or dare, Olivia?

1280
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:43,660
好吧 你得选择真心话
O-Okay. Okay, you have to pick truth.

1281
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,200
奥利维亚 快
Olivia, do it.

1282
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,630
- 大冒险 - 奥利维亚
- Dare. - Olivia!

1283
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:50,740
你必须...
I dare you...

1284
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,310
告诉玛姬你最害怕说出口的秘密
to tell Markie the secret you fear most.

1285
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,480
什么？它让你做什么？
What? Wh-What is it making you do?

1286
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:04,490
玛姬 我有件重要的事得告诉你
Markie, there's something important I need to tell you.

1287
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,190
是什么？
What?

1288
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:16,530
你爸死的那晚 我也在场
I was there the night your dad died.

1289
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,600
我知道发生了什么
I know what happened.

1290
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,470
什么？
What?

1291
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:23,700
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1292
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,410
那天我和父母吵了一架
I had gotten into a fight with my parents,

1293
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:28,770
所以就跑到你家去了
so I went to your house.

1294
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,380
你不在家 你爸招待了我
You weren't there, so your dad let me in.

1295
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,980
他当时在喝酒 请我一起喝
He... he was drinking, and he offered me one,

1296
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,620
我就喝了
so I took it.

1297
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,690
我们喝了少许之后 他对我说
We had a few, and then he told me

1298
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:41,920
那天他被解雇了 因为
that he had been fired that day, 'cause he was,

1299
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,560
他在上班的时候喝酒 听了之后
he was drinking on the job, and I just,

1300
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,230
我也替他感到难受
I felt really bad for him.

1301
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:50,230
我告诉他 你和我
But I told him that you and I

1302
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,300
会帮他度过难关的
would help him figure things out.

1303
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,640
然后她夸我很漂亮
And then he called me beautiful.

1304
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,740
我当时也喝的醉醺醺的 手足无措
And... I was drunk, and I didn't know what to do,

1305
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,810
他又开始靠近来亲我
and then he leaned in to kiss me,

1306
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,310
我试图推开他
and I-I tried to push him off.

1307
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:08,810
没有成功 他开始...
I didn't do it, but he...

1308
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,420
不断加强攻势
he kept coming back stronger.

1309
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:14,520
不过最后 我还是摆脱了他
But finally, I-I got free.

1310
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,460
他乞求我原谅他
He begged me to forgive him,

1311
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,660
他说他需要帮助 但因为当时我很害怕
said that he needed help, but I was so scared,

1312
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,660
脑子也很乱
and I was confused,

1313
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:27,670
我威胁他要把这事告诉你
and I threatened to tell you what happened,

1314
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:29,770
他说 如果你知道了 他就不活了
but he said that he would die if you ever found out.

1315
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:36,840
我对他说 你死了会感觉更好受的
I-I told him that you'd be better off if he were dead.

1316
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,450
玛姬 真的对不起
Markie, I am so sorry.

1317
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:46,280
我当时想告诉你 但当我联系上你时
I wanted to tell you, but by the time I got ahold of you,

1318
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,820
他已经自杀了 你知道后几乎奔溃
he had already done it, and you were devastated.

1319
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,060
我的心也碎了 我当时不知道该怎么办
It broke my heart. I didn't know what to do.

1320
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,060
- 相信我 我... 不
- Trust me, I.. - No.

1321
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,760
我再也不会相信你了
No, I'll never trust you again.

1322
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,700
- 玛姬...- 不要
- Markie... - Don't!

1323
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,400
不要
Don't.

1324
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,970
巴伦小姐
Miss Barron.

1325
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,740
到你了
You're up.

1326
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,710
"我知道那游戏
"I know the game

1327
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,810
"让你去把那个女人点着
"dared you to set that woman on fire.

1328
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,640
"告诉我在哪儿可以见到你
"Tell me where to meet you,

1329
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,650
"否则我就到你家门外等着
"or I'll wait outside your family's house

1330
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:16,850
直到大冒险游戏让我把你家烧了"
until the game dares me to do the same to them."

1331
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,920
这可是个大威胁啊
That is... quite a threat.

1332
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,450
我们通过IP地址追踪到了你笔记本
We traced the I.P. to your laptop.

1333
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,460
我知道这些话
I-I know that that...

1334
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,420
听起来很吓人 但我...
looks bad, but I...

1335
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,430
我只是想吸引她的注意
I just needed to get her attention.

1336
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:29,990
我知道你们在玩什么
Yeah, I know you're playing some kind

1337
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,860
真心话大冒险的游戏 但我搞不懂的是
of Truth or Dare game, but what I don't understand is:

1338
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,000
为什么会弄出人命？
why are people dying?

1339
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,830
现在只剩下你们四个人了
There's only four of you left.

1340
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,070
- 我希望能保住你们四个的命 - 四个？
- I'd like to keep the rest of you guys alive. - Four?

1341
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,700
死的这些人都去过墨西哥
Everyone who's dead was in Mexico.

1342
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:41,610
只剩下你 玛姬和卢卡斯
That leaves you, Markie and Lucas,

1343
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:43,310
还有吉赛尔的朋友 萨姆·米汉
and Giselle's friend, Sam Meehan.

1344
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,510
萨姆？
Sam?

1345
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,480
等等 他还活着？
Wait, he's alive?

1346
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,950
你认识他？
You know him?

1347
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,420
不认识
No.

1348
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:59,520
只是听吉赛尔提到过他
No, that-that's just someone that Giselle had mentioned.

1349
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:01,530
他在一个公寓里藏着
Ah. He's holed up in an apartment.

1350
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,830
拒绝和任何人说话 如果我想再找他聊聊
Won't talk to anybody. Said I had to arrest him

1351
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,930
得先逮捕他才行
if I wanted to speak to him again.

1352
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:08,670
奥利维亚 到底发生了什么事？
Olivia, what the hell is happening here?

1353
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,900
我能喝点水吗？
Could I get some water, please?

1354
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,470
谢谢
Thanks.

1355
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:21,750
马库斯 我需要一杯水
Marcus, I'm gonna need a glass of water.

1356
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,480
是 长官 马上就来
Yes, sir, right away.

1357
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,120
我被起诉了吗？
Am I being charged?

1358
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,460
还没有
Not yet.

1359
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,730
这就好 那我先走了
Okay, then I need to go.

1360
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:25,910
卡特就是萨姆
Carter is Sam.

1361
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,950
他用的是假名
He was using a fake name.

1362
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:29,980
那吉赛尔是故意把他们说成是两个人？
But Giselle acted like they were different people?

1363
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,050
她可能是想保护他
Well, she was probably trying to protect him,

1364
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:35,150
但不小心说出了真名 快
but she slipped up and she used his real name. Come on.

1365
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:22,670
玛姬？ 玛姬！
Markie? Markie!

1366
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,640
玛姬？
Markie?

1367
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:36,150
玛姬 快开门 我们得谈谈
Markie, please open the door. We need to talk.

1368
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,690
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1369
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:46,790
做我父亲做过的事
What my father did.

1370
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:49,230
玛姬 把枪放下
Markie, please put it down.

1371
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:52,030
为什么？
Why?

1372
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:53,800
我一无所有
I don't have anything.

1373
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,030
你还有我
You have me.

1374
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,040
不
No.

1375
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,540
现在我们都是那个游戏的傀儡
Now the game has us.

1376
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:05,240
我隐瞒你父亲的真相 是不想伤害你
I hid the truth about your dad to protect you.

1377
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:08,250
但我错了
But I was wrong.

1378
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,080
每一个日日夜夜
Every single day,

1379
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,750
我都真心地希望 能收回我对他说过的那些话
I wish I could take back what I said to him.

1380
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:17,060
他以前也试图自杀过
And he tried before.

1381
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:23,060
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1382
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,900
过去我们无法改变
We can't change the past.

1383
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,900
但我们可以把握未来
But we can still have a future.

1384
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,900
我们有办法结束这个游戏
We can end this game.

1385
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,070
什么办法？
How?

1386
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,510
那个卡特..我知道他在哪儿
Carter... I know where he is.

1387
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:55,890
好了 说说具体计划
Okay, so what's the plan?

1388
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,830
- 我们得把他带回那个教堂 - 嗯
- We just have to get him back to the mission. - Okay.

1389
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:02,070
所以 不要先告诉他"你得割下自己的舌头"
So don't open with "We need you to cut out your own tongue"?

1390
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:05,870
到了 6号
Here it is. Six.

1391
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:09,040
滚开 我不想和任何人说话
Go away! I don't want to talk to anyone!

1392
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,980
踹开
Screw this.

1393
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,380
- 等等 等等 等等 - 卡特
- Wait, wait, wait! - Carter!

1394
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,050
或者应该叫你萨姆？
Or is it Sam?

1395
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:17,110
- 你们怎么找到我的？- 我们找你是有目的的
- How did you find me? - We were motivated.

1396
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,150
- 这里面怎么空荡荡的？- 都是那个游戏害的
- What the hell happened in here? - The game.

1397
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:22,820
不和外界联系 这里没什么能伤害到我
No contact with the outside. Nothing in here can hurt me.

1398
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,220
- 这就是你的计划？ - 我的计划是耐心等待
- This is your plan? - My plan is to wait it out.

1399
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:27,730
不 那是你的第二计划
No, that was your second plan.

1400
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:29,190
你的第一计划是毁了我们
Your first plan was to screw us.

1401
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:32,760
就因为你 我三个最好的朋友都死了
Three of my best friends are dead because of you!

1402
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:35,070
抱歉 但我也有朋友死了 懂吗？
I'm sorry. I lost friends, too, okay?

1403
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:37,140
如果能挽回这一切 我什么都愿意做
If I could take it all back, I would.

1404
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:38,640
现在有个办法
There is a way.

1405
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,040
前提是我们都得回到那个教堂去
But we all have to go back to the mission.

1406
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,210
什么办法？结束游戏的办法吗？该怎么做？
A way to what? To what, end the game? How?

1407
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:46,950
相信我 咱们必须先回那儿去
Just... trust me. We have to go back.

1408
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:53,250
啊 不 这又是一次大冒险 对吗？
Uh-uh. No, this is another dare, right?

1409
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,050
- 那游戏让你们骗我出去是吗？ - 不是
- The game's daring you to lure me out? Is that... - No.

1410
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,390
她说的都是真的
She's telling the truth.

1411
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:00,730
我为什么要相信你们？
And why should I trust you?

1412
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,890
因为我们的目标相同
Because we want the same thing.

1413
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,300
我们都想活命
We want to survive.

1414
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:08,330
听着
Look...

1415
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,270
我现在要对你说那句 你当初在酒吧应该对我说的
I'm gonna tell you what you should've told me at the bar.

1416
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:13,140
滚开
Piss off.

1417
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:23,080
可爱的小奥利维亚是不会对任何人开枪的
Okay, sweet little Olivia's not shooting anyone.

1418
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:26,250
你试试看我敢不敢
Try me. I dare you.

1419
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,130
- 快 我们走 - 我走着呢
- Come on, let's go. - I am moving.

1420
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:39,060
穿过去
Right through here.

1421
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:41,000
走
Go.

1422
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,880
那个老修女教你的这个仪式
Is this ritual that old nun told you about

1423
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,280
真的管用么？
actually gonna work?

1424
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,660
只有试一试才知道
There's only one way to find out.

1425
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,230
所以要我们用一个驱魔仪式来结束这个游戏么？
So we're gonna end this with a séance?

1426
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:15,000
不是要我们 是要你来结束它
We are not ending it. You are.

1427
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,440
我？我试过了
Me? I tried.

1428
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,810
我们都知道结果会是什么
We all know how that turned out.

1429
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:26,450
跪下
Stay down.

1430
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:30,520
给 拿着 拿着
Here. Take this. Take it!

1431
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,350
念七遍
Say it seven times.

1432
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,290
你要怎么处理它？
What are you gonna do with that?

1433
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,160
我把它交给你
I'm giving it to you.

1434
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,360
拿着 快
Take it. Now!

1435
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:49,400
把上面写的念七遍
Now say the words seven times.

1436
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,800
快
Go!

1437
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,370
"是我召唤了恶魔..."
"Hermaro almas..."

1438
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:01,850
- 你们感觉到了吗？- 别停下
- Did you feel that? - Don't stop.

1439
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:04,210
- 告诉我发生了什么事 - 继续念
- Just-just tell me what's going on! - Keep going!

1440
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:07,150
好...
All right...

1441
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:10,090
"我愿以永远的沉默为代价 让恶魔永远消失"
"...silencia mi voz para que el mal no sea más.

1442
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:14,490
再念一次
Say it again.

1443
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:15,690
"是我召唤了恶魔...
"Hermaro almas,

1444
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:19,130
我愿以沉默为代价 让恶魔永远消失"
silencia mi voz para que el mal no sea más."

1445
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:24,400
再念五遍
Five more times.

1446
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,300
"是我召唤了恶魔 我愿以沉默为代价
"Hermaro almas, silencia mi voz

1447
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:28,210
让恶魔永远消失"
para que el mal no sea más."

1448
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,310
真心话还是大冒险 卢卡斯？
Truth or dare, Lucas?

1449
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,120
大冒险
Dare.

1450
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,820
"是我召唤了恶魔 我愿以沉默为代价
"Hermaro almas, silencia mi voz

1451
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,820
让恶魔永远消失"
mi voz para que el mal no..."

1452
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,130
- 你上哪儿去？- 我得离开这儿
- Where are you going? - Just got to get away from here.

1453
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:50,200
等等 等等 等等 你不能离开
Wait, wait, wait. You can't go.

1454
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,560
下一个就轮到你了
Your turn's next.

1455
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,330
我刚被问到了
I just had my turn.

1456
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:56,870
- 我得离开你们两个 - 为什么？
- Got to get away from you both. - Why?

1457
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:58,570
因为它让我做出选择..
Because it dared me to choose.

1458
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:00,040
你已经做出选择了 你爱的是玛姬
You already have. You love Markie.

1459
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,010
它让我选择你们其中一个杀掉
Choose which one of you to kill.

1460
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:08,450
卢卡斯
Luke.

1461
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:10,450
什么 他要离开？
What, so he's just leaving?!

1462
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,180
别停下 还有两遍
Don't stop. Two more times.

1463
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,620
"是我召唤了恶魔
"Hermaro almas,

1464
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,420
我愿以沉默为代价 让恶魔永远消失"
silencia mi voz para que el mal no sea más."

1465
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,890
卢卡斯？
Luke?

1466
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,560
卢卡斯？你为什么选大冒险？
Luke? Why did you pick dare?

1467
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,190
因为我不选 你们其中之一就得选
Because I knew if I didn't, then one of you would have to.

1468
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,260
我们感情如此深厚
And we're so close.

1469
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,200
我不会让它杀了你们
And I won't let the game kill you.

1470
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,270
你真是个傻瓜
You're such an idiot.

1471
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:33,000
要我怎么说呢？
What can I say?

1472
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:35,010
你那么对我
You do that to me.

1473
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:52,090
"是我召唤了恶魔 我愿以沉默为代价 让恶魔永远消失"
"Hermaro almas, silencia mi voz para que el mal no sea más."

1474
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:56,530
七遍了
That's seven.

1475
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:58,530
咱们快离开这儿 马上就天塌地陷了
We got to get out of here. This place is coming down.

1476
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:00,060
不行 你还有件事要做
No, there's one more thing to do.

1477
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,230
把刀捡起来
Pick up the knife.

1478
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,040
我不能帮你做
I can't do it for you.

1479
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,510
快捡起来
Pick it up!

1480
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:11,480
做什么？
And do what?

1481
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,680
很抱歉 萨姆
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1482
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,580
但因为是你解封了恶魔
But you unleashed this evil,

1483
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,680
所以也只有你能阻止它
which means you're the only one who can stop it.

1484
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:23,150
你得把自己的舌头割下来
I need you to cut out your tongue.

1485
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,690
不 这太疯狂了
N-No, that's insane.

1486
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:27,690
拜托 只有这样我们才能活命
Please! It's the only way we survive!

1487
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,570
你们好好照顾自己
You take care of each other.

1488
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,470
不
No.

1489
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:56,890
- 不 不 - 快动手
- No. No. - Do it.

1490
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:03,130
- 卢卡斯 停下 - 那不是卢卡斯
- Lucas, stop! - That's not Lucas.

1491
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,400
快割舌头 卡特
Do it now, Carter.

1492
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,130
不然就太迟了
Before it's too late!

1493
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:09,370
你不想活命吗？
Don't you want to live?!

1494
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:12,500
你别无选择 快动手
You do not have a choice! Do it!

1495
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:15,640
难以置信我要这么做
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

1496
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,650
我要杀掉你认识的每一个人
I will murder everyone you've ever known!

1497
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,190
不 他们没参与这游戏 只有我们参与了
No, they are not in this! It's just us!

1498
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:29,590
你说得对
You're right.

1499
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:32,520
但卢卡斯参加了 他没有完成大冒险
But Lucas is, and he didn't do his dare.

1500
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,160
所以现在他得死
So now he dies.

1501
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:00,120
不
No!

1502
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:25,180
卢卡斯拒绝执行大冒险 是为了保住我们的命
Lucas refused his dare to save us.

1503
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:29,180
我们必须结束这游戏
We have to finish this.

1504
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,650
加勒克斯杀了卡特 咒语不管用了
Calux killed Carter. The spell won't work.

1505
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:35,790
不 现在我们变成游戏发起人了
No, we lost the second we started this game.

1506
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:40,320
我们第二次来到这儿
The second we came here.

1507
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:42,430
卡特的大冒险是把我们带到这儿来
Carter was dared to bring us here,

1508
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:45,630
因为这儿是新玩家加入游戏的地方
because this is where you can add new people to the game.

1509
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:47,430
我有个主意 下一个轮到的是你
I have an idea. Your turn's next.

1510
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,670
到时候你要选择大冒险
When you're asked, I need you to pick dare.

1511
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:51,670
为什么？
Why would I do that?

1512
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:55,110
玛姬
Markie...

1513
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:57,740
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

1514
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:00,510
卢卡斯正在问我
Now Lucas is asking me.

1515
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:02,510
选择大冒险
Pick dare.

1516
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:05,220
- 但不要执行 - 什么？那样我会死的
- But don't do it. - What? I'll die.

1517
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,250
玛姬 我很抱歉
Markie, I am so sorry

1518
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,650
对你隐瞒了那么久的秘密
for keeping that secret from you for so long.

1519
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,390
但我现在对你发誓
And I swear to you

1520
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:13,390
我永远也不会再对你隐瞒任何事情了
I will never, ever keep anything from you again.

1521
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:15,790
我们只有选择相信彼此 才能活下去
But we survive this only if we trust each other.

1522
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,160
明白吗？
Okay?

1523
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:22,230
- 明白 - 相信我
- Okay. - Trust me.

1524
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:24,240
你得选了
You have to pick.

1525
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,870
大冒险
Dare.

1526
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:28,770
我要你对奥利维亚开枪
I dare you to shoot Olivia.

1527
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:32,340
他要我对你开枪
He wants me to shoot you.

1528
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,150
你得相信我 玛姬 不要那么做
You got to trust me, Markie. Don't do it.

1529
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:36,210
这是唯一能救我们的办法
This is the only way to save us both.

1530
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:39,120
好 我相信你
Okay. I trust you.

1531
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,160
我不做
I won't do it.

1532
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,260
不
No!

1533
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:56,430
大冒险完成了 加勒克斯
Dare complete, Calux.

1534
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,140
现在轮到你了
Your turn.

1535
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,910
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?

1536
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:02,470
我不玩这游戏
I'm not in this game.

1537
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,140
不 你一旦被问到 就算加入了游戏
No, once you're asked, you're in.

1538
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:05,780
这是规则 对吗？
Those are the rules, right?

1539
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,680
真心话还是大冒险 混蛋？
So, truth or dare, asshole?

1540
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,410
真心话
Truth.

1541
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:14,320
我们怎样才能活着离开这游戏？
How do we get out of this game alive?

1542
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:18,520
没办法
You can't.

1543
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,360
卡特是唯一能够结束这一切的人
Carter was the only one who could stop this.

1544
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,360
所以 在所有人都死了之前 游戏不会结束
So now the game won't end until all the players are dead.

1545
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:27,770
下一个轮到你了
And your turn's next.

1546
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:32,500
除非你找到新的朋友加入
Unless you find some new friends to play with.

1547
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:35,580
但你不会这么做 对吗？
But that's not gonna happen, is it?

1548
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,380
- 你的手臂 - 我没事
- Your arm. - I'm okay.

1549
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,250
这管用吗？
Well, did it work?

1550
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:46,750
还没结束
It's not over.

1551
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,750
游戏永远不会结束 除非我们都死了
The game will never end, not as long as we're alive.

1552
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,860
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1553
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:56,160
我在选择你
I'm choosing you.

1554
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:12,580
我和我的朋友们曾经到墨西哥
My friends and I went on a trip to Mexico

1555
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:15,610
去度春假
for spring break.

1556
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,750
最后一天 我们到了一个老教堂
We ended up in an old mission

1557
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,290
在那地方玩起了真心话大冒险的游戏
where we played a game of Truth or Dare.

1558
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,230
谁曾想我们遇到了一个卑劣无比的恶魔
We had no idea that we had encountered an unspeakable evil

1559
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,760
它也想和我们一起玩那个游戏
that wanted to play with us.

1560
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,300
我们回到家后 游戏仍在继续
When we went home, the game kept going.

1561
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,330
它杀死了我五个朋友
It killed five of my friends.

1562
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,870
那个游戏是真格的
The game is real.

1563
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:38,700
说出真心话 完成大冒险
Tell the truth, do the dare,

1564
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:41,000
否则你就得死 拒绝回答也得死
or you die; refuse to play, you die.

1565
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:45,880
在任何地方 任何人都可能对你发起提问
It can happen anywhere, and it can come from anyone.

1566
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:48,610
我很抱歉 但我不得不问你们...
I am so sorry, but I have to ask you...

1567
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,620
真心话还是大冒险？
truth or dare?

1568
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:26,470
真心话还是大冒险？
Truth or dare?
