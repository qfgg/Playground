00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,740
这里是博克岛
This is Berk,

7
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,870
这里的神秘感可谓是
the best kept secret this side of, well...

8
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,770
举世无双
Anywhere.

9
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,510
当然  可能看起来并不起眼
Granted, it may not look like much,

10
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,780
但这潮湿的岩石群中
but this wet heap of rock

11
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,010
却藏着不少惊喜
packs more than a few surprises.

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,750
这里的生活精彩绝伦
Life here is amazing,

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,620
只是不适合胆小鬼们
just not for the faint of heart.

14
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,630
要知道  其他地方的人都喜欢削削木头
You see, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling

15
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,800
或者绣绣花什么的  而我们博克岛人则喜欢
or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer...

16
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,600
一种小小的娱乐活动  名为
a little something we like to call...

17
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,440
赛龙
dragon racing!

18
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,090
抱歉啦  小鱼脚  你是想要这个吗
I'm sorry, Fishlegs, did you want that?

19
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,830
鼻涕唠  那是我的
Oh, Snotlout, that was mine!

20
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,430
宝贝  给你
Here you go, babe.

21
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,330
我有说过你今天看上去很美吗
Did I tell you that you look amazing today?

22
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,460
因为你真的很美
Cause you do.

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,730
走吧  喷喷
Come on, Barf.

24
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,470
臭味都传到我这儿来了
It's starting to stink around here.

25
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,730
放弃吧  她还是讨厌你
Nope, still hates you.

26
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,470
让这里燃起来吧  吐吐
Let's blow this place, Belch!

27
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,670
走着
All right!

28
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,410
加油
Come on!

29
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,580
好样的
Oh, yeah!

30
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,020
双胞胎得九分
That's nine for the twins!

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,350
艾丝翠得三分紧随其后
Astrid lags with three!

32
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,020
小鱼脚和鼻涕唠各得零分垫底
Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with none!

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,890
然后小嗝嗝
And Hiccup is...

34
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,860
还是不见踪影
nowhere to be found.

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,400
你的促膝谈心是不是吓到他了  史推克
Scared him off with the big talk, didn't you, Stoick?

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,130
你在干什么  鼻涕唠
What are you doing, Snotlout?

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,840
他们要赢了
They're gonna win now.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,510
她是我的女神  她有求  我必应
She's my princess... whatever she wants, she gets.

39
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,410
暴芙奈  她不是想把你活埋来着吗
Ruffnut? Didn't she try to bury you alive?

40
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,780
也就埋了几个小时
Only for a few hours.

41
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,380
快看他们  冲啊
Look at 'em, go!

42
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,750
龙曾是这里的
Now, dragons used to be

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,380
头号公敌
a bit of a problem here,

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,380
但那都是五年前的事了
but that was five years ago.

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,520
现在他们都在岛上定居了
Now they've all moved in.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,890
说真的  他们有什么理由不搬来这呢
And, really, why wouldn't they?

47
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,990
我们有定制的龙舍
We have custom stables,

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,990
全天供应的自助餐
all-you-can-eat feeding stations,

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,130
全方位的龙浴服务
a full-service dragon wash...

50
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,160
甚至还有最先进的火灾应对措施
Even top-of-the-line fire prevention,

51
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,600
我这么自夸请别见怪
if I do say so myself.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
是时候了  戈伯
Ah, it's time, Gobber.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
好的  最后一轮
Righty-ho. Last lap!

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,040
是黑羊  上吧  风中飞
The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!

55
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,980
我们还有机会赢得比赛
We can still win this thing!

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,720
-来吧  喷喷  -我们走
- Come on, Barf! -Let's go!

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
上啊  肉球
Go, Meatlug!

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,590
快飞  快飞
Let's go, let's go!

59
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,960
该你上场了
This is your big moment.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,130
祝你旅途愉快
Have a nice flight.

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,170
往上  往上  往上
Up! Up, up, up, up, up!

62
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,740
干得好  肉球
Good job, Meatlug!

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,140
给你  亲爱的  我的这个值十分
Here you go, darling. Mine's worth ten.

64
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,140
太好了  黑羊
Yeah! The black sheep!

65
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,010
你们两个在争暴芙奈吗
You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?

66
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,450
-我赢定了  -是我们俩一起赢
- I'm totally winning! - We're winning together.

67
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,520
不
Oh, no!

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,990
-我现在无人可挡了  -除了我
- Whoo! No one can stop me now! - Except for me.

69
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,660
我们是连在一起的  蠢材
We're attached, genius.

70
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,190
别想把我的荣耀偷走
Quit trying to steal all my glory!

71
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,700
-搞定他们  艾丝翠  -是我的荣耀
- Get them, Astrid! - It's my glory!

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,200
-成事不足败事有余  -没羊就没荣耀
- Always ruining everything! - No sheep, no glory!

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,840
抓到了
Gotcha! Ha-ha!

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
艾丝翠
Whoa! Astrid!

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,710
干得漂亮
Well played!

76
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,680
那是我未来的儿媳妇
That's my future daughter-in-law!

77
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,680
抱歉了
Uh, excuse me.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
风中飞
Stormfly!

79
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,230
一共十三分
That's 13!

80
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,270
艾丝翠赢得了比赛
Astrid takes the game!

81
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,700
没错  博克岛堪称完美
Yep, Berk is pretty much perfect.

82
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,110
我最终得偿所愿
All of my hard work has paid off.

83
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,940
而且这也是件好事
And it's a good thing, too,

84
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,780
维京人能驭龙翱翔之后
because with Vikings on the backs of dragons...

85
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,780
世界也变得辽阔了许多
...the world just got a whole lot bigger.

86
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,960
好赞
Yeah!

87
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
怎么样  伙计
So, what do you think, bud?

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,880
想再试一次吗
You want to give this another shot?

89
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,010
没牙仔  不会有事的
Toothless! It'll be fine.

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,250
准备好了吗
Ready?

91
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,690
好耶
Yeah!

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,030
棒
Yeah!

93
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,240
这感觉太棒了
This is amazing!

94
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
现在不棒了
No longer amazing.

95
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,280
没牙仔
Toothless!

96
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,280
不好
Oh, no!

97
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,800
刚刚真是始料未及
That really came out of nowhere.

98
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,710
我们得再训练下你的单独滑行  伙计
We-we got to work on your solo gliding there, bud.

99
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,750
那个固定尾翼
That, uh, locked-up tail

100
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,950
真不方便进行救援行动  是吧
makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, hey?

101
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,340
看来我们又找到一处  伙计
Looks like we found another one, bud.

102
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,380
怎么  你想要我道歉吗
Oh, what, do you want an apology?

103
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,080
就因为这个在生闷气吗
Is that why you're pouting,

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
小傻瓜
big baby boo?

105
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,120
试试这个
Well, try this on!

106
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,820
感受到了吗
Oh, you feeling it yet? Huh?

107
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,260
感受到我真诚的歉意了吗
Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse?

108
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,790
好了  得了  别这样
Ah. Yeah. Oh, come on, come on,

109
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,160
你不会想残害一个独腿的...
you-you wouldn't hurt a one-legged...

110
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,000
你是对的  你是对的
Y-you're right, you're right.

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
你赢了  你赢了
You win. You win.

112
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,340
他倒下了
He's down!

113
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,340
一场恶斗
And it's ugly!

114
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,940
龙和维京人
Dragons and vikings...

115
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,340
再次为敌
Enemies again...

116
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,780
战况愈演愈烈
Locked in combat to the bitter...

117
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,220
你知道口水洗不掉
You know that doesn't wash out.

118
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,380
我们给这里取什么名字好呢
So, what should we name it?

119
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,020
那就叫痒胳肢窝岛吧
"Itchy armpit" It is.

120
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,520
你觉得怎么样  伙计
What do you reckon, bud?

121
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,390
也许能在树林里找到几只割木龙
Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods?

122
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,490
或者在岩石群里找到些致命耳语龙
The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks?

123
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,130
谁知道呢  或许我们最终能找到
Who knows, maybe we'll finally track down

124
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,900
第二只夜煞
another Night Fury.

125
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,070
那可真是大发现
Wouldn't that be something.

126
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,100
你觉得呢
So, what do you say?

127
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,540
我们继续前进
Just keep going?

128
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,280
下午好  小姐
Afternoon, milady.

129
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,290
-你去哪了  -你好啊
- Where have you been? - Hi.

130
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,560
赢了几场比赛  不然呢
Oh, winning races. What else?

131
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,890
真正该问的是
The real question is,

132
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,200
你都去哪了
where have you been?

133
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,230
-躲我爸爸  -不是吧  又怎么了
- Avoiding my dad. - Oh, no. What happened now?

134
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,570
你肯定爱听这段
Oh, you're gonna... You're gonna love this.

135
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,600
我一早醒来  阳光明媚
I wake up, the sun's shining,

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,240
屋顶上有几只
Terrible Terrors are

137
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,410
恐怖龙在唱歌
singing on the rooftop,

138
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,070
我优哉游哉地下楼吃早饭
I saunter down to breakfast

139
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,480
想着世界上一切安好  结果我听到
thinking all is right with the world, and I get:

140
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,050
儿子  我们得谈谈
"Son, we need to talk."

141
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,910
现在不行  爸爸  我一整天
"Not, now, dad. I got a whole day of goofing off

142
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,080
都得忙着去瞎转悠呢
to get started."

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,850
好吧  首先
Okay, first of all,

144
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,450
我说话声音才不那样  你到底在模仿谁
I-I don't sound like that. What is this character?

145
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,460
其次
And-and second...

146
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,890
我才不会那样耸肩膀呢
What is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?

147
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,230
这也太夸张吧
Yeah, that's-that's a really flattering impersonation.

148
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,200
言归正传啊  他说
Anyway, he goes...

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,370
你是博克岛的骄傲  儿子
"You're the pride of Berk, son,

150
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,640
-我也以你为荣  -谢谢  爸爸
- and I couldn't be prouder." - "Aw, thanks, dad.

151
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,470
我也觉得自己很厉害
I'm pretty impressed with myself, too.

152
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,440
我什么时候变得这么爱挥手了
When have I ever done that with my hands?

153
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,080
你刚刚还那么做呢
You just did!

154
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,010
好吧  你就...
Okay, just...

155
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,410
先别动
Hold... still.

156
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,050
很严肃的
Very serious.

157
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,620
你也长大成人了
"You're all grown up,

158
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,460
既然你已经证明了自己能够委以重任
and since no chief could ask for a better successor,

159
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,130
-我决定...  -让你当部落首领  老天
- I've decided..." - To make you chief! Oh, my gods!

160
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,290
小嗝嗝  这太棒了
Hiccup, that's amazing!

161
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,200
频繁使用弹簧圈会磨损
Y-you're gonna wear out the spring coil.

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,500
很难校准的
The calibration is very sensitive.

163
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,110
没错  这就是
Yeah, so... this is

164
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,980
我现在头疼的事
what I'm dealing with.

165
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,240
你怎么答复他的
What did you tell him?

166
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,610
我没答复他
I-I didn't.

167
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,210
等他转过身来  我已经跑了
By the time he turned around, I was gone.

168
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,190
好吧  你已经身负重任了
Well... it's a lot of responsibility.

169
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,490
画地图的事肯定得暂时搁置
The map will have to wait, for sure,

170
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,120
如果以后你没有时间的话
and... and I'll need

171
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,030
就得由我来飞没牙仔  可是
to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy, but...

172
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,530
我无法胜任  艾丝翠
I-it's not me, Astrid.

173
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,700
那些演讲啊  规划啊  还有管理村庄
All those speeches and planning and running the village,

174
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,340
那是他的长项
that's his thing.

175
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,540
你没理解重点
I think you're missing the point.

176
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,140
我是说  当首领
I mean... chief.

177
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,570
多么荣耀
What an honor!

178
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,140
换我肯定激动死了
I'd be pretty excited.

179
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,050
但我不像你
I-I... I'm not like you.

180
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,320
你一直知道自己想要的是什么
You... know exactly who you are,

181
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,650
你一直都是  但是
you always have, but...

182
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,690
我还在找寻自己的方向
I'm still looking.

183
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,460
我知道自己不会像父亲那样
I know that I'm not my father,

184
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,490
我也没见过我母亲
and I never met my mother, so...

185
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,630
那我究竟该成为怎样的人呢
What does that make me?

186
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,570
你要找寻的并不在远方  小嗝嗝
What you're searching for isn't out there, Hiccup...

187
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,140
就在这里
It's in here.

188
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,280
也许只是你还没认识到而已
Maybe you just don't see it yet.

189
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,310
也许吧
Maybe.

190
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,110
但是
But, you know...

191
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,980
远方好像有什么东西
there is something out there.

192
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,680
小嗝嗝
Hiccup...

193
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,790
跟紧我
Stay close.

194
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,770
这里发生了什么
What happened here?

195
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,280
好了  放松  伙计
All right, e-easy, bud.

196
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,640
小嗝嗝
Hiccup!

197
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,310
-发射  -艾丝翠  小心
- Fire! - Astrid, look out!

198
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,290
小嗝嗝
Aah! Hiccup!

199
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,590
小心尾巴
Watch the tail!

200
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,230
把腿绑住
Tie those legs up!

201
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,640
-那不会是真的吧  -住手
- Is that what I think it is? - Stop!

202
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,370
风中飞
Stormfly!

203
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,810
你们要干什么
What are you doing?!

204
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,640
出现了
Back again!

205
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,580
我的老天
Soil my britches.

206
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,380
还真是一只夜煞
That is a Night Fury.

207
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,480
还以为他们都绝迹了
Thought they were all gone for good.

208
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,590
看来我们交上好运了  伙计们
Looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads!

209
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,560
德拉戈的龙族大军里
Don't think Drago has one of those...

210
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,390
肯定还没有夜煞呢
in his dragon army.

211
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,690
龙族大军
Dragon army?

212
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,690
听着  我们不想惹麻烦
Look, we don't want any trouble.

213
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,130
你在偷走我们所有的龙
Hah! You should have thought of that

214
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,600
并且摧毁我们的堡垒之前
before you stole all of our dragons

215
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,170
就该想到这点
and blasted our fort to bits!

216
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,870
-没错  -对  你瞧瞧
- That's right! - Yeah, look at it!

217
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,300
等等
Wait.

218
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,540
你们在说什么
What are you talking about?

219
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,170
你觉得这是我们干的吗
You think we did this?

220
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,780
捕龙这活儿本身已经够困难了  
Hah! Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is

221
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,210
结果还遇上个行侠仗义的龙骑士
without do-gooder dragon riders

222
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,180
-偷偷摸摸地救龙捣乱  -什么行侠仗义的...
- sneaking in to rescue them. - What do-gooder...?

223
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,850
还有别的龙骑士吗
There are other dragon riders?

224
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,760
除了你那个盗龙的朋友吗  你说呢
You mean other than your thieving friend from last night? You tell me.

225
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,860
你也许有只能喷冰的龙给你撑腰
You may have an ice-spitting dragon on your side,

226
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,430
但我们必须得完成我们的捕龙指标
but we still have a quota to fill.

227
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,660
你要我们怎么跟德拉戈·布达威斯
How do you suppose we explain this mess

228
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,200
解释这烂摊子
to Drago Bludvist?

229
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
德拉戈什么
Drago what-fist?

230
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
你说的这些都是什么意思
Does anything you say make sense?

231
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,540
他正等着明天我们为他的龙族大军
He's expecting a new shipment of dragons

232
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,740
扩充一群新成员
for his army by tomorrow.

233
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,440
德拉戈不喜欢听借口
And Drago don't take well to excuses!

234
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,280
上回空手回去
This is what he gave me

235
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,650
他就给了我这个
last time I showed up empty-handed.

236
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,750
他说以后就不会这么手下留情了
He promised to be far less understanding in the future.

237
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,620
好了  听着  我们没听过什么盗龙贼
All right, look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief

238
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,890
什么喷冰龙
or an ice-spitting dragon

239
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,890
或者你那个疯子老板
or your lunatic boss

240
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,330
还有他的龙族大军  好吗
and his dragon army, okay?

241
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,430
只要把我们的龙还回来  我们就离开
Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go...

242
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,230
我们从没见过这么凶巴巴的怪人
Strange, hostile person whom we've never met.

243
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,230
我的礼貌都去哪了
Oh, where are my manners?

244
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,640
我叫艾瑞特
I'm Eret...

245
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,440
和我父亲同名
Son of Eret.

246
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,710
世上最好的捕龙猎手
Finest dragon trapper alive.

247
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,510
毕竟
After all...

248
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,480
夜煞不是人人都能抓到的
it's not just anyone who can capture a Night Fury.

249
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,520
他叫没牙仔
And this is Toothless.

250
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,780
他说我们现在就离开
He says we're going. Now.

251
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
我们也等不及了
They all say that.

252
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,790
上  伙计们
Rush 'em, lads!

253
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,260
风中飞  快
Stormfly, come on!

254
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,530
撤  撤
Go! Go!

255
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
那些龙
You will

256
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,410
你是留不住的
never hold on to those dragons!

257
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,710
你听到了吗
You hear me?!

258
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,480
德拉戈会把它们全部抢走
Drago is coming for them all!

259
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,750
快点  肉球
Come on, Meatlug!

260
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,790
-你好  史推克  -你好
- Hey there, Stoick! - Hey, how are you?

261
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,960
天气真好
Beautiful day.

262
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,260
你好  嫉妒唠  比赛真棒
Hello, Spitelout. Great race. Yeah...

263
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,830
抱歉  艾克夫人
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. Ack.

264
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,530
-有他的消息吗  -他现在可能已经
- Any sign of him? - Eh! He's probably flown

265
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,840
飞得无影无踪了
off the edge of the world by now.

266
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,300
你确定想让那娃管理村庄吗
You sure you want that kid running the village?

267
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,410
你还有机会延迟退休
You can still delay your retirement.

268
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,980
他准备好了  你会明白的
Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

269
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,580
他来了
There he is!

270
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,250
博克岛的骄傲
Huh? The pride of Berk!

271
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,850
你总算决定回来工作了
Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.

272
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,620
抱歉  耽搁了
Sorry, got held up.

273
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,960
爸爸  能跟你聊两句吗
Hey, uh, dad, could I have a word?

274
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,620
有什么事等不及要告诉我了吗
Something you're itching to tell me?

275
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,970
不是你想的那件事
Uh, not quite the itch you're thinking of,

276
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,660
不过  确实有事
but, yes.

277
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,860
好样的
Oh, good man!

278
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,900
第一课  首领第一要务
Now, lesson one: A chief's first duty

279
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,270
就是服务于人民
is to his people,

280
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,600
所以  四十一号
so... 41!

281
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,470
我们能不能找个人少的地方聊聊
Well, can we just talk in private for...

282
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,500
-四十...  -是我
- Forty... - That's me!

283
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,740
是我  到我了
That's me! I'm next!

284
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,940
我排在你前面
Hey, I was ahead of you!

285
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,310
我们能不能谈...
If we could just talk...

286
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,380
不好意思  我都在这儿等一天了
Excuse me. I've been here all day.

287
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,740
我想要一个高龙鞍
Okay, okay, I want one of those high seaters

288
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,010
打满铁钉的那种  还要带一个大储物箱
with lots of spikes and a big storage compartment!

289
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,520
-没问题  保证给你  -爸爸  我要说的事
- Absolutely! You got it, sir. -Dad, this is actually

290
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,320
比造龙鞍更重要
a little more important than building saddles.

291
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,490
第二课  为人民服务
Ah, lesson two: No task is too small

292
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,390
不论大事小事
when it comes to serving your people.

293
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,490
-可是  爸爸  -抱歉  葛伦普
- But, dad... - Oh, excuse us, Grump.

294
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,790
-我们能不能谈谈  -葛伦普
- Can we just talk... - Yah! Grump!

295
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,030
你又让锻炉熄灭了
You let the forge die down again!

296
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,030
我受够了  葛伦普  你就等着被别人领养吧
That's it, Grump! You're going up for adoption.

297
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,510
-好的  -给你
- Okay, uh... - There you go.

298
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,780
-爸爸  -动手吧
- Dad... - Go on. Have away.

299
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,040
说真的  我必须
Yeah, but seriously, I really need to

300
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,310
把我们发现新大陆的事告诉你
tell you about this new land we came across.

301
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,980
-新大陆  -有新品种的龙吗
- Another one? - Any new dragons?

302
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,850
我们没能仔细探索
We didn't stick around to find out.

303
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,620
那些人不太友好
These folks weren't particularly friendly.

304
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,790
是吗
Oh, really?

305
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,560
你的夜煞还有致命纳得
Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder

306
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,020
没让他们乐翻天吗
didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?

307
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,560
这回不一样
No, this was different.

308
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,530
没有往常的兴高采烈
Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

309
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,860
和让我陶醉的欢呼
I've come to enjoy.

310
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,800
那些人都是猎手
These guys were trappers.

311
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,570
捕龙猎手
Dragon trappers.

312
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,000
你应该看看他们的堡垒
You should have seen their fort.

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,010
完全炸裂开  卡在巨大的冰锥里
All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice.

314
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,470
看上去无比怪异
It was weird.

315
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,080
我第一次见那样的场面
I've never seen anything like it.

316
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,740
最糟糕的是  他们以为是我们干的
A-and worst of all, they thought we did it!

317
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,580
你们俩总有一天
You know, you two are gonna get yourselves

318
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,920
会给自己惹上大麻烦
in serious trouble one of these days.

319
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,090
并不是所有人都喜欢这种生活方式
Not everyone appreciates this way of life.

320
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,390
戈伯说得没错  儿子
Aye, Gobber's right, son.

321
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,050
我们最好待在自己家乡
Best we keep to our own.

322
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,120
而且  你还有更重要的事要做
Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time.

323
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,860
只等我来宣布这个重磅消息了
Once we make the big announcement!

324
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,870
他们在组建龙族大军
They are building a dragon army.

325
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,900
或者说他们的老板在组建龙族大军
Or-or at least the guy they work for is. Uh...

326
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,740
叫什么德拉戈·被打威斯之类的
"Dargo... bloody fist" Or something.

327
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,740
要是他妄想抢走我的龙
I'll bloody his fist with my face

328
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,810
我就用我的脸血染他的拳头
if he tries to take my dragon!

329
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,850
还有我的
Or mine!

330
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,580
你还真白痴
Ugh! You're such a moron.

331
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,850
白痴美女哦
A beautiful moron.

332
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,390
没错
Yeah.

333
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,550
布达威斯  德拉戈·布达威斯是吗
Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

334
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,390
没错  等等
Uh, yeah. Wait...

335
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,920
你认识他吗
You know him?

336
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,000
-所有龙停飞  -什么  为什么
- Ground all dragons! - What? Why?

337
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,870
关上大门
Seal the gates!

338
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,000
-降下外门  -等等
- Lower the storm doors! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

339
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,570
-怎么回事  -快点
- What is happening? - Come on!

340
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,940
听命令  锁门
You heard the man! Lock it down!

341
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,640
没有我的命令
No dragon or viking

342
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,840
所有龙和维京人不准离开本岛半步
sets foot off this island until I give the word!

343
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,970
等等  就因为你认识的某人在遥远的
Wait, because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble

344
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,180
陆地制造麻烦吗
in some faraway land?

345
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,120
因为德拉戈·布达威斯是个疯子
Because Drago Bludvist is a madman

346
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,550
毫无道德和同情心可言
without conscience or mercy.

347
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,450
要是他组建了龙族大军
And if he's built a dragon army,

348
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,020
我们最好早做准备
gods help us all.

349
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,190
-把它们送回笼子  -是  史推克
- Get them into their pens! - Aye, Stoick.

350
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,930
快
Quickly!

351
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,860
那我们就飞回去
Then let's ride back out there.

352
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
跟着那些捕龙猎手找到德拉戈
We'll follow those trappers to Drago

353
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,660
劝他理智些
and talk some sense into him.

354
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,130
不  我们要在岛上建防御工事
No. We fortify the island.

355
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,170
维护和平是我们的责任
It's our duty to keep the peace.

356
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,900
和平结束了  小嗝嗝
Peace is over, Hiccup.

357
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,910
-我们必须为战争做好准备  -战争
- I must prepare you for war. - War?

358
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,180
爸爸  要是德拉戈来抢我们的龙
Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons,

359
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,040
我们不能坐以待毙
we can't wait around for him to get here.

360
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,510
我们去找到他  劝他改变想法
Let's go find him and change his mind.

361
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
不  有些人是劝不动的  小嗝嗝
No, some minds won't be changed, Hiccup.

362
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,920
你要担心的是博克岛
Berk is what you need to worry about.

363
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,490
首领要保卫自己的领土
A chief protects his own.

364
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,460
保护龙厩  全部上锁
Secure the stables! Latch every stall!

365
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,460
-小嗝嗝  别去  -我没得选
- Hiccup, don't. - I have to.

366
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,800
这边
This way!

367
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
快
Quickly!

368
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
小嗝嗝
Hiccup!

369
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,040
快
Come on!

370
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,510
小嗝嗝
Hiccup!

371
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,550
擦亮眼睛  伙计们
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

372
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,590
借着这阵风  我们天亮就能找到德拉戈
With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak.

373
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,960
所以我们最好把这艘船装满龙  要快
So best we fill this ship up with dragons, and quick!

374
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,560
没时间挑剔了
It's no time to be picky!

375
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,830
艾瑞特
Uh, Eret?

376
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,060
要是我们不想脑袋搬家...
Not if we want to keep our...

377
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,830
就抓紧时间
...heads!

378
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,770
在左舷船尾
Off the port quarter!

379
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,970
网住它们  伙计们  把它们打下来
Net them, lads! Take them down!

380
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,510
共有两只  在左上方
There's two of them! Up on the left!

381
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,610
这回你们逃不了了
You're not getting away this time.

382
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,780
开火
Fire!

383
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
装弹  装弹
Reload! Reload!

384
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,950
快  装弹  有人入侵
Come on, reload! Incoming!

385
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,180
稳住了  伙计
Steady yourselves, mates.

386
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,550
刚才我还在担心
And here I was,

387
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,850
我们会空手而归呢
worried we might turn up empty-handed.

388
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,890
不会的  今天是你的幸运日
Nope. It's your lucky day.

389
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,220
我们投降
We give up.

390
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,290
这有条夜煞
That's one Night Fury,

391
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,000
一条致命纳得
uh, one Deadly Nadder, and...

392
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,030
还有两位技压群雄的神秘龙骑士
Two of the finest dragon riders west of luk tuk.

393
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,840
这样老板就能满意了  是不是
That ought to make the boss happy, right?

394
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,600
借过
Excuse us.

395
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,840
你要干什么
What are you doing?

396
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,540
没牙仔  别动
Toothless, stay.

397
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,880
龙其实不喜欢
Uh, the dragons don't really care

398
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,280
狭窄的空间  所以它们跟你们待一起好了
for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you.

399
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,880
它们不会惹麻烦
They won't be any trouble.

400
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,220
除非你先挑事
Unless you do that.

401
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,690
汪洋大海上的一艘木帆
You know, wooden boats, big ocean...

402
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,560
你们的游泳技术怎么样
H-how is your swimming?

403
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,990
不太好
Not good.

404
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,990
差点忘了
Oops. Almost forget.

405
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,300
-囚犯不能携带武器  -把它给我
- Can't have armed prisoners. - Give me that.

406
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,030
这算什么计划
How is this a plan?

407
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,970
就是为捕龙猎人准备的
Just what every dragon trapper needs.

408
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,300
一边是涂着凶煞梦魇唾液的长剑
One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva.

409
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,070
另一边会喷射凶恶双头龙的瓦斯
The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas.

410
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,940
只需一点火花然后...
All it takes is a spark, and...

411
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,610
没错  就会这样
Oh, yeah, there you go.

412
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,050
它们一旦开始把你看作同类
Once they see you as one of their own,

413
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,650
那么就连最暴躁的龙都可以驯化
even the testiest dragons can be trained.

414
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,620
是吧  伙计
Right, bud?

415
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,650
把那个给我
Give me that!

416
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
你在玩什么把戏
What game are you playing?

417
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,930
不是把戏  我们只是想见德拉戈
Uh, no game. We just want to meet Drago.

418
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,660
为什么
Why?

419
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,130
因为我要改变他关于龙的想法
Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.

420
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,000
他劝人很有一套
He can be really persuasive.

421
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,670
只要赢得龙的忠心
Once you've earned his loyalty,

422
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,210
他便会为你赴汤蹈火
there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.

423
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,680
你改变不了这里任何人的想法
You won't be changing any minds around here.

424
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,080
我此时此地就可以改变你的想法
I can change yours, right here, right now.

425
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,920
我可以吗
Uh, may I?

426
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,920
-当心  -龙骑士
- Watch it! - Dragon riders!

427
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,730
放我下去
Put me down!

428
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,800
鼻涕唠  你要干什么
Snotlout, what-what are you doing?

429
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,740
看我把你保护得多好
See how well I protect and provide?

430
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,300
那些网是干什么的
What is with all the nets?

431
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,910
小心  刚才真是...
Hey, watch it! That was...

432
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,210
危险
Close.

433
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,310
我的天呐
Oh, my.

434
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,290
我的菜啊
Me likey.

435
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,190
带我走吧
Take me.

436
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,430
停止射击
Hold your fire!

437
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,200
你们在这干什么
Um, what are you guys doing here?

438
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,370
我们来解救你
We're here to rescue you!

439
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,140
我不需要解救
I don't need to be rescued.

440
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,980
够了
Enough!

441
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,380
你们是不是
Well, didn't you just pick

442
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,180
上错船了
the wrong ship, eh?

443
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,020
我是艾瑞特  和我父亲...
I am Eret, son of...

444
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
同名...
Eret...

445
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,820
我...
I...

446
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,360
把这家伙从我身上弄走
Get this thing off me.

447
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,020
还有谁
Anyone else?

448
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,890
我猜也是
Hmm, that's what I figured.

449
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
你  备龙鞍
You, saddle up.

450
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
我们回家
We're going home.

451
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,230
不
No.

452
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,130
简直毫无责任心
Of all the irresponsible...

453
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,100
我要保护我们的龙  阻止一场战争
I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war.

454
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,340
这怎么能是不负责任呢
How is that irresponsible?

455
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,970
因为战争正是他想要的  儿子
Because war is what he wants, son!

456
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,920
多年前  有过一场盛大的首领聚会
Years ago, there was a great gathering of chieftains

457
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,450
专门讨论我们当时面临的龙灾
to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced.

458
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,990
从我们中走出一位来自陌生大陆的陌生人
Into our midst came a stranger from a strange land,

459
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,760
浑身布满伤疤  身披一顶龙皮斗篷
covered in scars and draped in a cloak of dragon skin.

460
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,430
他不带武器
He carried no weapon

461
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,130
语气柔和
and spoke softly,

462
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,470
说他叫
saying that he,

463
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,840
德拉戈·布达威斯
Drago Bludvist,

464
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,900
是一介平民
was a man of the people,

465
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,480
致力于从龙的奴役中解放人类
devoted to freeing mankind from the tyranny of dragons.

466
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,940
他说他仅凭一己之力就可以控制龙
He claimed that he alone could control the dragons,

467
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,310
他独自一人就可以保证大家安全
and that he alone could keep us safe,

468
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,450
只要我们臣服于他
if we chose to bow down

469
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,990
追随他
and follow him.

470
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,820
-愚蠢至极  -真好笑  
- Stupid. - Ah, good one.

471
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,030
对  我们也笑了
Aye, we laughed, too...

472
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,470
直到他裹紧斗篷
Until he wrapped himself in his cloak

473
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,960
高喊着
and cried out,

474
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,830
那就等着瞧没有我你们怎么办
"Then see how well you do without me!"

475
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,430
等着瞧没有我你们能怎么办
...See how well you do without me!

476
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,400
房顶瞬间燃起大火
The rooftop suddenly burst into flames,

477
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,210
身披盔甲的龙从火中蹿出
and from it, armored dragons descended,

478
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,340
把大厅烧成了灰
burning the hall to the ground.

479
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,180
我
I...

480
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,810
是唯一一个幸存者
was the only one to escape.

481
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,390
杀人不找理由的人不会和你讲道理的
Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with.

482
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,260
-也许吧  -小嗝嗝
- Maybe. - Hiccup!

483
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,330
不过我还是要试试
I'm still going to try.

484
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,000
这是我所擅长的
This is what I'm good at,

485
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
既然我能改变你的想法
and-and if I could change your mind,

486
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,470
就能改变他的
I can change his, too.

487
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,500
出发
Come on.

488
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,870
-出发  -不
- Let's go. - No!

489
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,810
带其他人回博克岛去
Lead the others back to Berk.

490
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,240
这一天已经够乱的了
I've had enough mutiny for one day.

491
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,320
好喜欢这个
Ooh, I like that.

492
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,080
暴芙奈
Ruffnut!

493
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,920
来了
Okay!

494
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,170
别担心  伙计
Don't worry, bud.

495
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,140
我不会让任何人伤害到你
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

496
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,850
我向你保证
I promise.

497
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,160
得了  爸爸
Aw, come on, dad.

498
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,860
没完没了了吗
Really?

499
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,600
好吧
Okay.

500
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
别轻举妄动
No sudden moves.

501
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,330
稳住  稳住
Hold on, hold on.

502
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,610
没牙仔
Toothless...!

503
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,060
你把我的龙扔在那儿了
You left my dragon back there!

504
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,500
他自己不能飞  他会被淹死的
He can't fly on his own! He'll drown!

505
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,020
我们得调头去找我的龙
We have to head back for my dragon!

506
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,200
你是谁
Who are you?

507
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,070
盗龙贼吗
The dragon thief?

508
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,780
德拉戈·布达威斯吗
Drago Bludvist?

509
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,680
你听得懂
Do you even understand

510
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
我说话吗
what I'm saying?

511
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,420
没牙仔
Toothless!

512
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,220
没事了  没事了  没事了
Oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

513
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,330
我也很高兴见到你  伙计
I'm glad to see you, too, bud.

514
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,610
你真让我担心死了
You really had me worried there.

515
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,680
小嗝嗝
Hiccup?

516
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,850
这是真的吗
C-could it be?

517
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,190
这么多年过去了
After all these years?

518
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,690
这怎么可能呢
How is this possible?

519
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,320
难道...
Uh, should I...

520
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,660
我认识你吗
should I know you?

521
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,830
不
No.

522
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,530
你当时还是个婴儿
You were only a babe.

523
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,640
但母亲绝不会忘记自己的孩子
But a mother never forgets.

524
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,550
跟我来
Come.

525
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,380
倔脾气
Boar-headed!

526
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,720
和他母亲一模一样
Just like his mother!

527
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
她也从不肯老实待着
Aye, she could never stay put, either.

528
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,790
他才二十岁嘛
Eh, he's just 20,

529
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,360
而且还是一个维京人
and a Viking.

530
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,040
这俩因素恐怕是最糟的组合了
I mean, could there be a worse combination?

531
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,330
想想你自己早年是有多么的
Heh! When I think of how stubborn and senseless

532
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,760
固执和愚蠢
you were back in the day.

533
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,460
天啊
Oh.

534
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,200
我看其实现在也没变多少
Well, not much has changed, actually.

535
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,440
你也知道那孩子
Ah, you know what he's like.

536
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,310
他不会放弃的  戈伯
He won't give up, Gobber.

537
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,910
而且如果小嗝嗝在我们找到他之前
And if Hiccup finds Drago

538
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,240
就找到了德拉戈的话...
before we find him...

539
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,780
小嗝嗝不会有事的
Ah! Nothing can hurt Hiccup,

540
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,910
只要那条夜煞跟在他身边
so long as that night fury's around.

541
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,380
那可是条夜煞啊
It's a night fury!

542
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,450
怎么了
Huh?

543
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,640
找到他们  裂颅
Find them, skullcrusher.

544
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,670
找到他们
Find them.

545
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,880
等等  稍等一下
Uh, h-hold on. Wait just a minute.

546
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,280
-这边  -回来
- This way. - Come back here.

547
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,920
-来  -你不能
- Come. - You can't just say

548
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,220
说完那种话然后转身就走
something like that and run off.

549
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,690
你是我妈妈
You're my mother?!

550
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,290
我是说  究竟怎么...
I mean, what the...?

551
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,330
你  你能理解这听起来有多疯狂吗
Do you... do you grasp how insane it sounds?

552
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,560
快来
Come quickly.

553
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,730
我有话问你
I have questions!

554
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,600
这么些年你到底
Where have you...

555
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
去了哪里
been all this time?

556
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,600
你一直在做什么
What-what have you been doing?

557
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,540
但他们告诉我说你死掉了
But they-they said you were dead!

558
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,870
所有人都以为你是被龙吃掉...
Everyone thinks you were eaten by...

559
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,980
这就是你二十年来待的地方吗
This is where you've been for 20 years?

560
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,990
你一直致力于拯救他们
You-you've been rescuing them.

561
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,830
简直难以置信
Unbelievable.

562
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,560
-你不生气吗  -什么
- You're not upset? - What?

563
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,360
不  我不知道
No. I-I don't know. I...

564
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,030
说老实话  我还没回过神来呢
It's a bit much to get my head around, to be Frank.

565
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,900
有点疯狂凶猛的义务龙骑士自称是我母亲
It's not every day you find out your mother

566
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,070
这种事毕竟不是每天都会遇到的
is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.

567
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,650
至少我并不无趣  对吗
At least I'm not boring, right?

568
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,420
我想这点
Well, I suppose there is that...

569
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,520
确实如此
one specific thing.

570
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,360
你喜欢吗
Do-do you like it?

571
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,420
我
I...

572
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,690
我
I... I...

573
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,660
我找不到合适的词来表达
I-I don't have the words.

574
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,800
我能摸摸他吗
C-can I...

575
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,070
他真美
Oh, he's beautiful.

576
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,510
惊艳绝世
Oh, incredible.

577
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,080
他很有可能就是他们种族的最后一只了
He might very well be the last of his kind.

578
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,550
瞧啊
Oh... and look,

579
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,090
他和你一样大呢
he's your age.

580
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,360
怪不得你们这么合得来
No wonder you get along so well.

581
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,090
他的牙还可以收缩
And retractable teeth.

582
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,400
你怎么做到的
How did you manage...

583
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,930
我在树林里发现了他
I found him in the woods.

584
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,500
他被打了下来  受了伤
He was shot down and wounded.

585
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,870
这只比齿龙因为
This snafflefang lost his leg

586
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,580
德拉戈·布达威斯的铁捕龙夹丢了一条腿
to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.

587
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,050
这只止雨龙的翅膀
This raincutter

588
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,410
被剃刀网划伤了
had her wing sliced by razor netting.

589
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,780
还有这只可怜的陆行龙
And this, oh, poor hobblegrunt

590
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,690
被一个树枝陷阱弄瞎了
was blinded by a tree snare

591
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,920
在孤单害怕中被丢下等死
and then left to die alone and scared.

592
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,990
这是怎么回事
And what of this?

593
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,990
又是德拉戈和他的捕龙夹干的好事吗
Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?

594
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,030
这个啊
Yeah.

595
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,770
奇葩的点在于
Well, crazy thing is...

596
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,710
把他打下来的人其实是我
I'm actually the one who shot him down.

597
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,470
不过没事的
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.

598
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,540
他也报复我啦
He got me back.

599
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,940
对吧  伙计
Right, bud?

600
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,910
你就不能把我完整的救下来
You couldn't save all of me, could you?

601
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,680
非要跟我扯平不可
You just had to make it even.

602
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,550
所以才有了这假肢
So peg leg.

603
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,160
你父亲对你这夜煞朋友是什么看法呢
What did your father think of your night fury friend?

604
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,190
一开始他不怎么接受
Oh, he-he didn't take it all that well.

605
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,060
不过后来  他改变了
But then, he changed.

606
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,200
大家都变了
They all did.

607
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,800
很快
Pretty soon,

608
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,640
家乡的人都有了自己的龙
everyone back home had dragons of their own.

609
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,840
那怎么可能
If only it were possible.

610
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,940
不  是真的
No, really.

611
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,010
相信我吧  我也这样尝试过
Believe me, I tried, as well,

612
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,050
但是人们不会真的改变的  小嗝嗝
but people are not capable of change, Hiccup.

613
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,580
有些人
Some of us...

614
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,850
就是天生与众不同
were just born different.

615
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,060
博克岛当时面临的命运
Berk was a land of kill

616
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,630
就是杀戮或被杀
or be killed,

617
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,600
但我当时相信和平的希望尚存
but I believed peace was possible.

618
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,870
住手  你这样只会让事情更糟
Stop! You'll only make it worse!

619
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,540
但没人接受我的观点
It was a very unpopular opinion.

620
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,710
小嗝嗝
Hiccup!

621
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,510
有一天
Then one night,

622
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,610
一条龙闯进了我们家  找到了
a dragon broke into our house, finding you

623
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,180
摇篮里的你
in the cradle.

624
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,550
我冲过去保护你
I rushed to protect you.

625
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,530
却看到了证明我一直以来信仰的证据
But what I saw was proof of everything I believed.

626
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,940
他们不是残暴的野兽
This wasn't a vicious beast,

627
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,880
他们是种聪明的  温和的生物
but an intelligent, gentle creature,

628
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,580
我们的灵魂产生了共鸣
whose soul reflected my own.

629
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,590
-瓦尔卡  快跑  -不  不要
- Valka, run! - No, don't.

630
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,260
坚持住
Hold on!

631
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,300
不要  史推克
No! Aah! Stoick!

632
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,670
瓦尔卡
Valka!

633
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,270
史推克
Stoick!

634
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,010
瓦尔卡
Valka.

635
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,280
那晚你和你父亲
You and your father nearly died

636
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,880
差点丧命
that night.

637
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,880
只因为我不忍心杀死一条龙
All because I couldn't kill a dragon.

638
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,080
家族遗传啊
Eh, runs in the family.

639
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,150
离开你们让我心碎
It broke my heart to stay away,

640
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,620
但我想只有如此你们才更安全
but I believed you'd be safer if I did.

641
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,760
你是怎么活下来的呢
How did you survive?

642
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,030
跃云并没想伤害我
Oh, cloudjumper never meant to harm me.

643
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,160
他肯定是觉得我属于这里
He must have thought I belonged here

644
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,100
这个令人炫目的野兽之家
in the home of the great bewilder beast.

645
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,310
阿尔法族
The Alpha species.

646
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,170
世上所剩无几的
One of the very few

647
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,140
其中之一了
that still exist.

648
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,880
每个龙巢都有龙后
Every nest has its queen,

649
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,320
但他才是龙族之王
but this is the king of all dragons.

650
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,720
他可以喷出冰
With his icy breath,

651
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,320
这只美丽的巨兽就这样为我们建起了龙巢
this graceful giant built our nest,

652
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,760
一个所有龙族都可以安然居住的天堂
a safe haven for dragons everywhere.

653
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,060
等等  那就是喷冰龙吗
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

654
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,930
那个被摧毁的堡垒
He's responsible

655
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,100
就是他干的吗
for all that destruction?

656
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,970
他保护着我们
He protects us.

657
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,300
我们受他保护
We all live under his care

658
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,140
并听令于他
and his command.

659
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,210
当然  除了龙宝宝
All but the babies, of course...

660
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,810
因为龙宝宝谁的话也不听
who listen to no one.

661
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,730
我和他们住在一起二十年了  小嗝嗝
I've lived among them for 20 years, Hiccup,

662
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,330
探索着他们的秘密
discovering their secrets.

663
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,870
他喜欢你
He likes you.

664
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,910
你一定饿了吧
You must be hungry.

665
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,670
有点  吃点东西也好
Uh, yeah, I could eat.

666
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
太好了
Good.

667
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,080
因为用餐时间到了
It's feeding time.

668
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,820
我感觉不好
I don't like it.

669
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,960
他们早该找到小嗝嗝一起回来了
They should've been back with Hiccup by now.

670
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,120
我也不开心
I don't like it, either.

671
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,330
与他父亲同名的艾瑞特
Eret, son of Eret,

672
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,990
就是我的梦中情人
was the man of my dreams.

673
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
我的一切
My everything!

674
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,860
可是宝贝  我都为你留了胡子啊
But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.

675
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,800
我也是
Me, too.

676
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,300
如果他们被德拉戈打下来了怎么办
What if Drago shot them down?

677
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,000
说不定他们需要我们帮忙
What if they need our help?

678
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,770
我们得去找他们
We have to find them.

679
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,810
等等  什么
Wait, wait, what?

680
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,970
不行  史推克说
No, but Stoick said...

681
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,210
要是他们真被抓了
It doesn't matter what he said

682
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,410
不管他说过什么都不重要了
if they've all been captured.

683
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,780
走吧
Come on!

684
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,880
我们要回去吗
Do we go back?

685
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,150
我们现在无处可去
We've nowhere to go,

686
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,150
无货可卖  而且都
nothing to sell, and no heads

687
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,420
性命难保了
to call our own.

688
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,060
-艾瑞特  -如果我们不快点
- Uh, Eret...? - If we don't turn up

689
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,430
找到几只龙的话
with dragons and fast...

690
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
许愿时要小心哦
Careful what you wish for!

691
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,730
-想想办法  -艾瑞特
- Do something! - Eret, son of Eret!

692
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,730
我们会想念你的  艾瑞特
We'll miss you, Eret!

693
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,730
搞什么啊
What is this?

694
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,900
绑架你啊
A kidnapping.

695
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,440
我带他飞行吗  行吗
Yay, can he ride with me? Can he?

696
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,740
行吗
Can he...?

697
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,110
你带我们去找德拉戈
You're gonna show us the way to Drago.

698
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,770
然后帮龙骑士
And help dragon riders

699
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,280
偷偷溜进德拉戈的营地吗
sneak into Drago's camp?

700
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,340
还是现在杀了我算了
Just kill me now.

701
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,450
没问题啊
That could be arranged.

702
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,110
风中飞  放开他
Stormfly, drop it.

703
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,780
什么
Huh?

704
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,050
好样的
Good girl!

705
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,090
风中飞  抓住他
Stormfly, fetch.

706
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,190
好吧
All right!

707
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,160
好吧  我带你们去找德拉戈
Okay! I'll take you to Drago!

708
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,800
百试不爽
Works every time.

709
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,470
我们不是要去吃东西吗
Hey, I-I thought we were going to eat.

710
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,240
是啊
Oh, we are.

711
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,220
之后  从龙之岛开始
And then, from Dragon Island,

712
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,310
我又发现了这些群岛
I found this archipelago...

713
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,120
好了
There.

714
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,310
每次我身处高空
Oh, when I'm up here,

715
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,170
甚至都感觉不到寒冷
I don't even feel the cold.

716
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,540
完全沉浸在...
I just feel...

717
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,880
自由里
Free.

718
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,580
这就是
This is what it is

719
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,850
成为龙的感觉  小嗝嗝
to be a dragon, Hiccup.

720
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,920
你完全可以
It's all well and good

721
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,160
自称为龙
to call yourself a dragon,

722
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,390
不过你能飞吗
but can you fly?

723
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,450
哦不
Oh, no!

724
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,630
伙计  真是千钧一发
Man, almost!

725
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,960
我们这次差点就成功了
We just about had it that time.

726
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,500
棒极了
Incredible.

727
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,940
你也不赖
Well, not bad yourself.

728
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,020
这么多年以来  你竟然这么像我
All this time, you took after me.

729
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,920
可是
And...

730
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,690
我却在哪里
where was I?

731
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,190
我真的非常抱歉  小嗝嗝
I'm so sorry, Hiccup.

732
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,160
我们重头再来可以吗
Can we start over?

733
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,100
你能再给我一次机会吗
Will you give me another chance?

734
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,100
我  我可以教你这二十年来
I-I can teach you all that I've learned

735
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,110
我学到的一切
these past 20 years.

736
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,610
比如...
Like...

737
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,520
现在你可以做急转弯了
Now you can make those tight turns.

738
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,690
你知道你能这样吗
Did you know about this?

739
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,290
每种龙
Every dragon

740
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,530
都有自己独特的秘密  而且
has its secrets. And...

741
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,560
我会把这些都教给你
I'll show them all to you.

742
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,100
我们可以解开所有的谜题
We'll unlock every mystery,

743
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,170
找到所有种族  母与子  我们俩一起
find every last species... together, as mother and son.

744
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,180
我们共同拥有的这个天赋  小嗝嗝
This gift we share, Hiccup,

745
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,180
把我们紧紧联系在了一起
it bonds us.

746
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,280
这才是真实的你  儿子
This is who you are, son.

747
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,050
真实的我们
Who we are.

748
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,690
我们可以改变龙族的世界
We will change the world for all dragons.

749
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,490
把它变的更好更安全
We will make it a better, safer place.

750
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,090
好啊  我是说
Yeah, I mean,

751
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,530
听起来很棒
that sounds amazing.

752
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,580
这简直太棒了
Oh, this is so great!

753
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,780
你可以和我一起去和德拉戈谈谈
Now you and I can go talk to Drago together.

754
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,250
什么
What?

755
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,580
跟德拉戈没什么好谈的
There's no talking to Drago.

756
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,080
-但我们得  -不行
- But we have to... - No.

757
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,350
我们必须保护我们的龙
We must protect our own.

758
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,450
走吧
Come on.

759
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,790
我们该回去了
We should be getting back.

760
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,070
好了  我已经把你们带来了
Okay, I got you here!

761
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,410
快把这家伙弄走
Now get this thing off me.

762
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,210
永远不要和龙抢玩具
Never take a toy from a dragon.

763
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,710
你怎么什么都不懂
Don't you know anything?

764
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,610
为什么倒霉的总是我
Why does this keep happening to me?

765
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,560
那下面是什么啊
What's down there?

766
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,700
吐出的水泡直径很大
Large diameter bubbles,

767
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,470
说明肺部巨大
massive lungs,

768
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,700
居住在深海冰水里  我想
cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking

769
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,710
应该是五级巨兽
class five leviathan,

770
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,340
或许有六级
maybe six.

771
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,120
肉球  你怎么了  宝贝
Meatlug, what's wrong, girl?

772
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,990
钩牙  振作啊
Hookfang! Come on!

773
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,290
不许动
Don't move!

774
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,680
德拉戈
Drago!

775
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,220
放开我
Get off me!

776
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,690
见到你总是很高兴  我的朋友
Always great to see you, my friend.

777
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,820
在这儿取暖呢
Keeping warm up here?

778
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,890
如你所见  我可是准时
Well, as you can see, I am right on time

779
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,830
带了一批新龙过来哦
with a new batch of dragons,

780
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,230
和我保证的一样
just like I promised.

781
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,830
他要醒过来了  拉住他
He's waking up! Drop the ropes!

782
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,400
来人支援一下
Give me some backup here!

783
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,900
小心
Watch out!

784
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,500
放下绳子
Drop the ropes.

785
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,270
钩牙
Hookfang!

786
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,610
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

787
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,280
你如今属于我了
You belong to me now.

788
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,710
另外作为额外赠送的礼物
And as an added bonus,

789
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,320
我还把他们的骑手给你抓来了
I also caught you their riders.

790
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,520
不另外收费哦
No extra charge.

791
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,750
什么  你在开什么玩笑
What? Are you kidding me?

792
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,860
但你之前真是太完美了
But you were so perfect!

793
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,390
我后来发现  有好大一群龙骑士
Turns out there's a whole bunch of them out there.

794
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,230
他们攻击了...
They attacked...

795
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,890
有多少
How many?

796
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,600
原来德拉戈没抓住他们
Drago doesn't have them after all.

797
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,930
-有多少  -上百个
- How many? - Hundreds.

798
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,530
有满满一岛的人呢
A whole island full.

799
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,570
我倒是不担心
I wouldn't worry about it.

800
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,840
说话这会儿我的人就在追捕他们呢
My men are hunting them down as we speak.

801
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,540
他们不会发现你的藏身之处的
They won't know where you're hiding.

802
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,980
我向你保证
I promise you that.

803
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,240
他们会发现的  他们知道我们失踪了
Oh, yes, they will! They know we're missing,

804
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,310
而且他们有会追踪的龙
and they have tracking dragons.

805
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,820
如果你敢碰我们  小嗝嗝会狠狠揍...
If you so much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna kick...

806
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,780
-小嗝嗝  -他不会坏你的事儿的
- Hiccup? - He's not a problem.

807
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,850
真的  相信我
Really, trust me.

808
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,260
他是伟岸的史推克之子
He's only the son of Stoick the Vast,

809
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,260
是博克岛首领的继承人
his heir to the throne of Berk,

810
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,760
还是有史以来最棒的驯龙大师
and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen.

811
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,800
驯龙大师
"Dragon master"?

812
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,470
我是唯一一个能控制龙的人
I alone control the dragons.

813
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,110
-并不是呢  -不好意思哦
- Nope, mm-mm. - Sorry!

814
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,210
除非你放我们走  马上就放
And unless you let us go right now,

815
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,830
不然他将会骑着他的夜煞袭卷这里
he will blast through here on his Night Fury

816
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,070
然后把你的整支船队
and blow your entire fleet of ships

817
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,410
卷成碎片
to splinters.

818
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,410
然后他们会像小宝宝一样哭泣
Then they'll be crying like babies.

819
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,900
真是幽默风趣
Funny and beautiful.

820
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,780
说得好  宝贝儿
Good one, babe.

821
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,450
没错  像小宝宝一样哭泣
Yeah. Like babies.

822
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,780
他们总是哭个不停
They always cry.

823
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,690
真是群小不点
Real tiny ones.

824
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,020
起先  你说只有一个龙骑士
First there was one rider,

825
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,690
现在整个博克岛都是了
and now all of Berk?

826
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,590
而且你还带着他们找上门来了
And you led them to me!

827
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,360
德拉戈
Drago...!

828
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,370
停下一切准备工作
Stop all preparations!

829
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,400
我们必须得马上出击龙骑士的老巢
We must attack the dragon riders' nest at once!

830
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,770
我们要干掉他们龙王
We will take down their Alpha.

831
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,680
然后占领整个博克岛
Then we will take Berk!

832
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,510
德拉戈
Drago!

833
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,720
干掉他
And get rid of him.

834
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,790
德拉戈  拜托  我...
Drago, please, I...

835
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,290
风中飞
Stormfly!

836
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,460
不
No!

837
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,510
伙计...
Well, bud...

838
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,610
我们不能等着德拉戈来攻击这地方
We can't wait around for Drago to attack this place.

839
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,550
我们得先一步找到他
We've got to find him first.

840
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,790
走吧
Let's go.

841
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,700
淡定
Easy now.

842
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,760
你开什么玩笑  你是怎么进来这里的
Are you kidding me? How did you get in here?

843
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,330
我们怎么进来就怎么出去
The same way we're getting you out.

844
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,030
-我们  -安全
- "We"? - All clear.

845
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,940
-没牙仔  跟上  -等等  等等
- Toothless, come. - Uh, wait, uh, wait...

846
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,670
好吧  爸  有...有件事你得知道
Okay, uh, dad, there-there's something you need to know.

847
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,740
行  行  路上再说
Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

848
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,740
这可不是什么可以"路上再说"的问题
Well, this isn't an "on the way" kind of update, actually.

849
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,940
我不想再听了  小嗝嗝
I've heard enough, Hiccup.

850
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,610
还有更多惊天动地的
More-more of the earth-shattering

851
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,780
事件发展和变化
development variety.

852
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,410
是啊是啊  又一件
Yeah, just add it to pile.

853
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,020
没错  我
Yeah, I,

854
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,390
爸  和其他大部分我告诉你的"惊喜"不同
dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you,

855
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,690
我保证你会喜欢这个的
this is one you'll like, I promise.

856
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,720
只不过你需要小心消化一下
You just have to handle it delicately.

857
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,690
所以...
So...

858
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,730
也许你会想自己处理一下这个
You might want to take this one.

859
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,530
什么
Huh?

860
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,130
天啊
Oh, boy.

861
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,510
爸爸  能请您把剑放下吗
Dad, could you put the sword away, please?

862
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,860
我知道你想要说什么  史推克
I know what you're gonna say, Stoick.

863
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,120
我怎么能那么做
How could I have done this?

864
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,630
这些年来一直躲在外面
Stayed away all of these years,

865
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,700
还有为什么我没有回到你身边
and why didn't I come back to you?

866
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,660
回到儿子身边
To our son?

867
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:32,600
我看到了任何你可能会改变的希望吗  史推克
What sign did I have that you could change, Stoick?

868
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,890
或者是博克岛的人可能会改变的希望
That anyone on Berk could?

869
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,910
我祈求了这么多次
I pleaded so many times

870
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,910
希望你们停止战争  去寻找其他解决方法
to stop the fighting, to find another answer,

871
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,710
但是你们有人听过我的话吗
but did any of you listen?

872
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,180
这就是我不结婚的原因
This is why I never married.

873
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,450
这是一个原因  还有另一个
This, and one other reason.

874
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,790
我知道我留你独自一个人抚养小嗝嗝
I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone,

875
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,820
但我想着没有我在身边  他会更好
but I thought he'd be better off without me,

876
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,430
但是我错了
and I was wrong.

877
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,990
如今我看清了这一点  但是...
I see that now, but...

878
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,470
别这么一言不发的  史推克
Stop being so stoic, Stoick.

879
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,680
快啊
Go on,

880
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,800
大吼  大叫  说点什么
shout, scream, say something!

881
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,780
你还是和我失去你的那天一般美丽
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.

882
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,040
这一天还能更糟糕吗
Could this day get any worse?

883
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,210
让我瞧瞧
Uh, let me see.

884
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,820
我们就要跳进冰冷的水里
We're gonna jump into freezing cold water

885
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,250
然后被淹死了
and then die from drowning.

886
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,950
看起来真凉爽
Looks refreshing.

887
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,150
请吧  女士优先
Please, ladies first.

888
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,590
你就是一坨龙大便
You are a steaming heap of dragon.

889
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,240
蹲下
Duck.

890
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,060
快去警告其他人
Warn the others!

891
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,930
抓住他们  艾瑞特
Get them, you son of an Eret.

892
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,040
接招
Take that!

893
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,580
好吧  我再次爱上了你
Okay, I love you again.

894
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,610
真是可悲呀
Oh, pathetic.

895
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,850
你还可以去跳海
You can still jump.

896
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,880
我们还要不要去救出你们的龙
So, are we going to save your dragons

897
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,880
然后逃离这里了
and get out of here or not?

898
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,150
检查每一个捕龙夹
Check every trap.

899
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,120
他们就在这儿的某个地方
They're here somewhere.

900
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,630
肉球
Meatlug?

901
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,840
有人往这边来了吗
Anyone coming?

902
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,880
不知道  你继续做手头上的事就好
I don't know, you just keep doing what you're doing.

903
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,770
继续转
Keep cranking.

904
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,160
谢谢你救了我一命
Thank you for saving my life.

905
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,070
现在让我还你一个人情吧
Now let me return the favor.

906
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,040
妈妈  你绝对会认不出来那个地方的
Mom, you'd never even recognize it.

907
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,240
过去我们造武器的地方
Where we used to make weapons,

908
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,340
如今用来造龙鞍
we now build saddles,

909
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,870
翅蹬
wing slings...

910
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,840
我们...我们甚至还给龙补牙
We-we even fix dragon teeth.

911
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,280
你不会相信一切的变化是有多大
You-you wouldn't believe how much everything's changed.

912
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,580
是呀  你儿子把博克岛变得更好了
Aye, your son's changed Berk for the better.

913
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,650
我觉得这件事上我们做得不错  瓦尔卡
I think we did well with this one, Val.

914
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,820
谢谢爸爸
Thanks, dad.

915
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,650
我来
I got it.

916
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,790
我来
I got it.

917
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,630
我...
I'm, uh...

918
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,000
有点生疏了
a little out of practice.

919
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,870
你知道的
Well, you know,

920
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,360
我又不是因为你的厨艺才娶你的
I didn't marry you for your cooking.

921
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,540
希望不是
I hope not.

922
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,880
她做的肉丸  杀伤力比一把战斧都大
Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle ax.

923
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,380
我的肚子对她的肉丸可一直印象深刻呢
I've still got a few knocking around in here.

924
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,180
只要你带着你所有的龙一起回来
And once you move back in with all your dragons,

925
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,650
老德拉戈根本毫无胜算
old Drago won't even stand a chance.

926
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,610
一切都会顺顺利利的
Everything will be okay.

927
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:10,790
慢点  儿子
Slow down, son.

928
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,160
还有很多需要考虑的事情
It's a lot to take in.

929
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,290
我明白了
Oh, gotcha.

930
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,400
我爱死这个了
Oh, I love this one.

931
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,990
还记得我们的歌吗  瓦尔卡
Remember our song, Val?

932
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:50,970
我将畅游航行在茫茫大海中
 I'll swim and sail on savage seas

933
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,930
不曾畏惧巨浪淹没我
 With ne'er a fear of drowning

934
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:04,030
欢乐地驾驭着生活的波涛
 And gladly ride the waves of life

935
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,500
只要你愿嫁给我
 If you will marry me

936
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,010
无论炙热的太阳
 No scorching sun

937
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,570
或是刺骨的寒凉
 Nor freezing cold

938
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,780
都不会...
 Will...

939
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,290
都不会阻挡我的...步...伐...
Will stop me on my... journey

940
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,170
不好意思
Sorry.

941
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,510
只要你许我你的芳心
 If you will promise me your heart

942
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,160
并且爱...
 And love...

943
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:51,740
并且爱我永不停
 And love me for eternity

944
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,310
我最亲爱的我的宝贝
 My dearest one my darling dear

945
00:58:56,310 --> 00:59:00,600
你话语掷地有声震撼我
 Your mighty words astound me

946
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,910
但我并不需要这些海誓山盟
 But I've no need of mighty deeds

947
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,060
只要你的臂弯环绕我
 When I feel your arms around me

948
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,720
但我愿送你金戒指
 But I would bring you rings of gold

949
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,200
也愿为你吟歌唱诗
 And even sing you poetry

950
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,760
真的吗
Oh, would you?

951
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,850
我会护你远离一切灾难
 And I would keep you from all harm

952
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,190
只要你愿待在我身旁
 If you would stay beside me

953
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,490
金戒指对我没有用
 I have no use for rings of gold

954
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,840
我也不欣赏你的诗
 I care not for your poetry

955
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,270
我只希望能牵着你的手
 I only want your hand to hold

956
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,510
我只希望你在我身旁
 I only want you near me

957
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,810
爱你  吻你  紧拥你
 To love and kiss, to sweetly hold

958
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,980
与你共舞  共入梦乡
 For the dancing and the dreaming

959
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,740
一起走过风风雨雨
 Through all life's toils and delights

960
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,690
我将把你的笑容珍藏在身侧
 I'll keep your laugh inside me

961
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,440
我将畅游航行在茫茫大海中
 I'll swim and sail the savage seas

962
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,310
不曾畏惧巨浪淹没我
 With ne'er a fear of drowning

963
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,970
欢乐地驾驭着生活的波涛
 And gladly ride the waves of life

964
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,610
只要你愿嫁给我
 If you will marry me

965
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,110
-我还在坚持唱哦...  -戈伯
- I'm still going... - Gobber.

966
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,210
我唱完了
I'm done.

967
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,480
我还以为至死也不能与你共舞了呢
I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again.

968
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,290
没必要给我下猛药啦
No need for drastic measures.

969
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,290
为了你  我亲爱的...
For you, my dear...

970
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:01,120
我愿意做任何事
Anything.

971
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,090
你愿意回家吗  瓦尔卡
Will you come home, Val?

972
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,370
你愿意重新成为我的妻子吗
Will you be my wife once again?

973
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,910
我们可以重组一个家庭
We can be a family!

974
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,310
你愿意吗
What do you say?

975
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,910
我愿意
Yes.

976
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,580
太棒了  以后做饭我来
Great! I'll do the cooking.

977
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,920
感谢奥丁神你没听我的话  儿子
Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son.

978
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,260
不然我们永远都找不到对方了
We never would've found each other.

979
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,300
没牙仔
Toothless?

980
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,070
发生什么事了
What's happening?

981
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:04,250
不...
Oh, no...

982
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,860
瓦尔卡...
Val...

983
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,860
瓦尔卡  没事的  没事的
Val, it's all right, it's all right.

984
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,260
我们现在是一个团队了
We're a team now.

985
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,530
现在  你想怎么办
Now, what do you want to do?

986
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:13,160
我们得拯救那些龙
We have to save the dragons.

987
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,250
好的  没问题
Aye, you got it.

988
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,500
来吧  儿子
Come on, son!

989
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,540
装弹
Reload!

990
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,110
开火
Fire!

991
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,120
开火  开火
Fire! Fire!

992
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,390
不管任何代价  坚持进攻那座山
Whatever comes, keep hitting the Mountain.

993
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,390
我们得把龙王引出来
We need to draw the Alpha out.

994
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,910
准备好捕龙夹
Ready the traps!

995
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,960
惊喜
Surprise!

996
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,460
好耶
Yeah!

997
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,460
什么
What?!

998
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,530
你身上还真是惊喜连连呢
You really are full of surprises.

999
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,130
走吧
Let's go.

1000
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,100
龙骑士驾到
Dragon riders coming through!

1001
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,470
喷火
Fire!

1002
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,010
太好了
Oh, yeah!

1003
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,420
把他们砍下来
Cut them down!

1004
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,120
和父亲同名的艾瑞特
Eret, son of Eret!

1005
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,970
往上飞  姑娘
Up, girl!

1006
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,210
向左倾斜  艾瑞特
Lean left, Eret!

1007
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,340
就是这样
That's it!

1008
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,110
小心
Look out!

1009
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:15,390
耶  宝贝儿
Yeah, baby!

1010
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,720
干掉他们
Take them down!

1011
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,560
当心哦[双关为"抬头"]
Heads up!

1012
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,670
驯龙大师
Dragon master.

1013
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,400
欢迎加入  龙骑士
Welcome aboard, dragon rider.

1014
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,040
我得说  谢谢
Thanks. I think.

1015
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,640
你去哪儿了
Where have you been?

1016
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,640
和妈妈叙叙旧
Oh, you know, catching up with mom.

1017
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,120
那是你妈妈
That's your mother?!

1018
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,060
现在你知道我的表演天赋是从哪来的了吧
Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.

1019
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,070
龙王
The Alpha!

1020
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,440
我们有场硬仗要打了
Now we have a fight!

1021
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,680
来吧  没牙仔
Come on, Toothless.

1022
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,050
让他们瞧瞧你的厉害  伙计
Show them what you got, bud.

1023
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,830
好样的
Attaboy!

1024
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,340
这一刻我等了许久了
I've waited a long time for this.

1025
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,710
你无法夺走我们的龙
You cannot take our dragons!

1026
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,450
他们是由龙王控制的
They are controlled by the Alpha!

1027
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:51,380
还好我带来了一位挑战者
Then it's a good thing I brought a challenger.

1028
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,710
另一只龙王
Another one?

1029
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:19,210
那可是只十级的龙  十级的
That is a class ten! Class ten!

1030
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,410
小心
Look out!

1031
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,590
-不...不要...  -来吧
- No... no... - Come on!

1032
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,620
干掉那只龙王
Take down the Alpha!

1033
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:27,160
不要
No!

1034
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,170
谢谢
Thank you.

1035
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,870
为了你  我亲爱的...
For you, my dear...

1036
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,840
我愿意做任何事
Anything.

1037
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,380
瓦尔卡  你觉得你能阻止他们吗
Val, do you think you can stop them?

1038
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,820
我会尽力的  来吧  跃云
I'll do my best. Come on, Cloudjumper!

1039
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,820
你
You!

1040
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,190
我看着你被烧着了
I watched you burn!

1041
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:08,530
想杀我这点火还不够
It takes more than a little fire to kill me!

1042
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,580
史推克
Stoick!

1043
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,370
不要
No!

1044
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,270
不要
No!

1045
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,660
我们赢了
We've won.

1046
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,000
现在...
Now...

1047
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,730
干掉她
Finish her!

1048
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,270
不要
No!

1049
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,480
坚持住
Hold on!

1050
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,780
冲啊  裂颅
Skullcrusher, go!

1051
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,910
跟上  戈伯
Come on, Gobber!

1052
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,350
紧紧跟在你后面呢  史推克
Right behind you, Stoick!

1053
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,640
停下
Stop!

1054
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:04,040
停下
Stop!

1055
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,920
这...就是所谓的驯龙大师吗
This... is the great dragon master?

1056
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,450
伟岸的史推克之子吗
The son of Stoick the Vast?

1057
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,760
他该感到多羞愧啊
What shame he must feel.

1058
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,490
所有这些伤害...
All of this loss...

1059
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,030
都为了些什么
And for what?

1060
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:28,000
就为了变得无人能敌吗
To become unstoppable?

1061
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,430
就为了统治世界吗
To rule the world?

1062
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,160
龙  他们...他们是善良的
Dragons, they-they are kind,

1063
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,310
神奇的生物  能与人类和平相处
amazing creatures that can bring people together.

1064
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,010
或者伤害人类
Or tear them apart.

1065
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:47,800
你瞧  我知道生活在恐惧中是什么滋味
You see, I know what it is to live in fear,

1066
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,790
知道自己的村庄被焚毁
to see my village burned,

1067
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,820
家庭被毁灭是什么滋味
my family taken.

1068
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,560
但是即便小时候
But even as a boy

1069
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,760
我无依无靠
left with nothing,

1070
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,930
我也发誓要
I vowed to rise above

1071
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:03,570
战胜对龙的恐惧
the fear of dragons

1072
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:08,340
并且解放这世上所有的人
and liberate the people of this world.

1073
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:10,640
那为什么要组建龙族军队
Then why a dragon army?

1074
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,040
你要用龙来战胜其它龙
Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.

1075
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:18,450
又或者你是要用龙来征服人类
Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people

1076
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,350
来控制追随你的人
to control those who follow you

1077
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,820
消灭违抗你的人
and to get rid of those who won't.

1078
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,690
聪明
Clever boy.

1079
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:31,130
世界需要和平
The world wants peace,

1080
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,460
博克岛已经找到了人龙和平共处的方式
and we have the answer back on Berk.

1081
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,600
让我展示给你看吧
Just... let me show you...

1082
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,670
不
No!

1083
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:40,440
还是让我
Let me

1084
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,470
展示给你看看吧
show you!

1085
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,120
搞什么
What in...

1086
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,090
小嗝嗝
Hiccup!

1087
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,560
快来  戈伯
Come on, Gobber!

1088
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,030
好吧  计划有变
Okay, change of plan.

1089
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,830
任何龙都无法违抗龙王的命令
No dragon can resist the Alpha's command.

1090
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,870
所以谁控制了龙王
So he who controls the Alpha

1091
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:16,170
也就控制了所有龙
controls them all.

1092
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,010
没牙仔
Toothless?

1093
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,790
没牙仔  你没事吧  伙计  怎么了
T-toothless, you okay, bud? What's going on?

1094
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,650
让你见识一下真正的厉害
Witness true strength.

1095
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:35,860
控制其它龙的强大意念力
The strength of will over others.

1096
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,430
与之相比
In the face of it,

1097
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,800
你微不足道
you are nothing.

1098
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,640
他刚刚跟你说了什么
Uh... what did he just tell you?

1099
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,950
没牙仔  拜托
Toothless, come on.

1100
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,750
你怎么了
What's the matter with you?

1101
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,550
不  不  不  拜托  你这是干吗
No, no, no, no, come on, what are you doing?

1102
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,950
别这样
Knock it off.

1103
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:05,460
停  快醒过来
Stop! Snap out of it!

1104
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,730
没牙仔  不要
Toothless, no!

1105
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,700
没牙仔
Toothless!

1106
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,070
-不要  -小嗝嗝
- Don't! - Hiccup!

1107
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,710
-住手  -儿子
- Stop...! - Son!

1108
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:25,710
爸
Dad!

1109
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:26,980
别过来
No!

1110
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,860
不
No...

1111
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,840
爸
Dad!

1112
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
史推克
Stoick...

1113
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,580
爸
Dad?

1114
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,820
不  你
No. You...

1115
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,660
不
No.

1116
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:30,710
不  不  不  不
No, no, no. No.

1117
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,330
不  别碰他
No! Get away from him!

1118
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,830
走  走开
Go on! Get out of here!

1119
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,670
走开
Get away!

1120
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:03,640
这不是他的错
It's not his fault.

1121
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,940
你心里清楚
You know that.

1122
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,920
驯良的龙
Good dragons

1123
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,780
在坏人的控制下
under the control of bad people...

1124
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:18,220
-不  等等  别走  -也会做坏事
- No, wait. Don't go. - do bad things.

1125
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,780
快点
Come on!

1126
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,110
召集所有人在博克岛会合
Gather the men and meet me at Berk!

1127
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,680
-没牙仔  -不  别去
- Toothless! - No, don't.

1128
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,740
愿武神迎接你
May the Valkyries welcome you

1129
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,780
引领你穿过奥丁的伟大战场
and lead you through Odin's great battlefield.

1130
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:21,050
愿他们用爱和狂怒歌唱你的名字
May they sing your name with love and fury,

1131
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:25,020
让我们听到由瓦尔哈拉殿堂深处传来的颂歌
so that we might hear it rise from the depths of Valhalla,

1132
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:25,020
{\an8}北欧神话主神兼死亡之神奥丁接待英灵的殿堂

1133
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,890
在国王之桌上
and know that you've taken your rightful place

1134
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:31,790
你已获得了应有的席位
at the table of kings.

1135
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,060
一位伟人从此陨落
For a great man has fallen.

1136
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,700
他同时也是一名勇士
A warrior.

1137
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
一位族长
A chieftain.

1138
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,740
一位慈父
A father.

1139
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,040
和一位挚友
A friend.

1140
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,940
对不起  爸
I'm sorry, dad.

1141
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,260
我没能成为
I'm not the chief that

1142
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,430
你期望中的领袖
you wanted me to be.

1143
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:40,000
也没能像我想象中那样捍卫和平
And I'm not the peacekeeper I thought I was.

1144
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,230
我  不知道
I... don't know...

1145
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,380
你是个早产儿
You came early into this world.

1146
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:03,020
你出生的时候个子好小
You were such a wee thing.

1147
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:06,520
是那么脆弱  那么不堪一击
Oh, so frail, so fragile.

1148
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,090
我害怕你会夭折
I feared you wouldn't make it.

1149
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,460
但是你父亲
But your father...

1150
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,270
他从未怀疑过
he never doubted.

1151
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:20,540
他总说你会成为他们之中最强壮的一个
He always said you'd become the strongest of them all.

1152
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,840
他说对了
And he was right.

1153
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:27,010
你拥有领袖的心胸
You have the heart of a chief,

1154
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:29,450
和龙的灵魂
and the soul of a dragon.

1155
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:34,180
只有你才能把我们的世界维系起来
Only you can bring our worlds together.

1156
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:38,250
你就是这样的人  儿子
That... is who you are, son.

1157
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,170
我
I, uh...

1158
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:57,310
我曾好怕变成父亲那样
I was so afraid of becoming my dad.

1159
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,240
因为我觉得我将永远无法做到像他那样
Mostly because I thought I never could.

1160
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,310
酒精怎么才能成为一个
How-how do you become someone...

1161
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,920
那么伟大  那么勇敢
that great, that... brave,

1162
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,420
那么无私的人呢
that... selfless?

1163
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,490
我想我只有尽力了
I guess you can only try.

1164
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:27,000
首领要保卫自己的领土
A chief protects his own.

1165
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,540
我们要回去
We're going back.

1166
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:37,180
-怎么回  -他把所有龙都带走了
- Uh... with what? - Uh, he took all the dragons.

1167
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,550
不是所有龙
Not all of them.

1168
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,590
我还不想死啊
I don't want to die!

1169
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,860
我们根本没办法控制这些家伙
We can't fly these things!

1170
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,030
是啊  就是说啊
Yeah, no kidding!

1171
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,240
可是那只龙王
But won't that bewilder beast

1172
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,010
不会也把这些小家伙给控制了吗
just take control of these guys, too?

1173
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,910
他们是龙宝宝  才不会听任何人的呢
They're babies! They don't listen to anyone.

1174
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,040
是啊  就像我们一样
Yeah. Just like us.

1175
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,610
这实在是  太危险了
This is... whoa... very dangerous!

1176
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,620
有些人可能会说
Some might suggest

1177
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,220
这主意糟透了
this is poorly conceived!

1178
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,260
还好我从不听话
Well, it's a good thing that I never listen.

1179
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,090
那你
So

1180
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,100
到底有什么
what is your...

1181
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,460
计划
plan?

1182
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,430
夺回没牙仔  狠狠教训德拉戈
Get Toothless back and kick Drago's...

1183
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,270
小心
Heads up!

1184
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:33,140
还有这件事
And that thing.

1185
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,630
好孩子
Ah, that's a good boy.

1186
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:06,300
看  看着点家具
W-w-watch the furniture!

1187
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,440
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1188
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:29,020
你们的首领已经死了
Your chief... is dead!

1189
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,390
-史推克  -不  不可能
- Stoick? - No! Not possible!

1190
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,000
现在没人能保护你们了
No one can protect you now!

1191
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,680
不
No.

1192
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:54,480
他带走了所有龙
He took all the dragons.

1193
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,120
引开龙王
Distract the Alpha.

1194
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,590
让他无暇顾及没牙仔
Try to keep his focus off of Toothless.

1195
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:00,090
怎么引开他啊
Uh, how?

1196
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:02,260
你忘了你的战斗伙伴是谁了吗
Have you forgotten who you're riding with?

1197
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:05,690
就没有我驯服不了的龙
There isn't a dragon alive that I can't wrangle! Aah!

1198
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,760
-这只除外  -半吊子
- Except for this one...! - Amateur.

1199
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,230
看啊  是小嗝嗝
Hey, look! It's Hiccup!

1200
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,710
什么
What?

1201
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,790
继续扔羊
Keep 'em coming!

1202
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,490
黑羊来了  宝贝
Black sheep, baby!

1203
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,670
十分
Ten points!

1204
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,790
我没事
I'm okay!

1205
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,700
我承认  想甩掉你还真不容易
You certainly are hard to get rid of, I'll say that.

1206
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,700
没牙仔
Toothless...

1207
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,800
是我  伙计
It's me, bud.

1208
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,310
是我
It's me.

1209
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,370
是我  我在这呢  伙计
It's me. I'm right here, bud.

1210
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,280
回我这来
Come back to me.

1211
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,850
他已经不是你的了
He's not yours anymore.

1212
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,250
他现在属于龙王
He belongs to the Alpha.

1213
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,720
但是  请便吧  驯龙大师
But, please, o great dragon master,

1214
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,360
你可以试试
try... to take him.

1215
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,790
他第二次可不会失手了
He will not miss a second time.

1216
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,130
那不是你的错  伙计
It wasn't your fault, bud.

1217
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,870
是他们逼你做的
They... made you do it.

1218
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,710
你永远也不会伤害他的
You'd never hurt him.

1219
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,680
你永远也不会伤害我的
You'd never hurt me.

1220
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,860
你是怎么做到的
How are you doing that?

1221
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,360
求求你了  你是我最好的朋友  伙计
Please. You are my best friend, bud.

1222
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,400
我最好的朋友
My best friend.

1223
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,640
好样的  这就对啦
Attaboy! That's it!

1224
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,670
我就在这儿
I'm here.

1225
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,380
够了
Enough!

1226
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,320
坚持住
Hang on!

1227
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:47,620
我快够到你了  伙计  我这就来了
Almost there, buddy, almost there.

1228
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:59,270
想想办法啊
Do something!

1229
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:01,240
我们得把他们俩分开
We need to get those two apart.

1230
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,950
我们必须屏蔽掉控制  没牙仔
We gotta block him out, Toothless.

1231
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,780
你信任我吗  伙计
Do you trust me, bud?

1232
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:19,690
我们能做到的
We can do this.

1233
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,460
你和我
You... and me...

1234
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,190
一心同体
as one.

1235
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,960
没错
That's it.

1236
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:31,300
咱俩再试一次
Now let's try this one more time!

1237
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,400
打败他  宝贝
Take him down, babe!

1238
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:38,940
去打败他
Go get him.

1239
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,780
控制它啊
Take control of it!

1240
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,720
别受他干扰  没牙仔
Shut it out, Toothless.

1241
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,350
-阻止他们  -就是现在
- Stop them! - Now!

1242
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:12,710
又来
Not again.

1243
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,950
没牙仔  成败就看现在了
Toothless, it's now or never!

1244
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,350
来啊  伙计
Come on, bud!

1245
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:24,590
稳住
Hold on!

1246
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,030
我们成功了
Ya-ha! We did it!

1247
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,840
盯住他  没牙仔
Hold him there, Toothless.

1248
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,970
一切都结束了
It's all over now.

1249
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,280
是吗
Or is it?

1250
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,350
不
Oh, no!

1251
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,790
不
No!

1252
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:03,760
不
No!

1253
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,730
小嗝嗝
Hiccup...

1254
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,430
他在挑战龙王
He's challenging the Alpha!

1255
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,970
为了保护你
To protect you!

1256
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,860
不  不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no! No!

1257
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,870
反击啊  反击
Fight back! Fight!

1258
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:19,070
反击
Fight!

1259
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,970
你这是怎么了
What's the matter with you!

1260
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,980
坚守阵地  决不动摇
Hold your ground! Hold the line now!

1261
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,480
你现在明白了吗
Now do you get it?

1262
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:39,020
这才叫赢得了龙的真心
This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

1263
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:42,820
让这一切就此结束吧
Let this end now.

1264
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,060
永不
Never!

1265
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,430
上啊
Come on!

1266
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,950
反击
Fight!

1267
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,020
真正的龙王会保护所有的龙
The Alpha... protects them all.

1268
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,680
你总是让我刮目相看  伙计
You never cease to amaze me, bud.

1269
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,850
谢谢
Thank you.

1270
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,560
没牙仔  你知道口水洗不掉
Toothless, you know that doesn't wash out!

1271
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,680
我就知道你会回来的
I knew you'd come back

1272
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,900
你回来了  宝贝
You're back, my beauty!

1273
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:04,670
风中飞
Stormfly!

1274
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,240
让我抱抱  葛伦普
Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

1275
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:15,310
谁是我的小公主
Who's my little princess!

1276
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:17,010
你再也不许离开我了  钩牙
Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang.

1277
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:19,950
-就是你  没错  就是你  -想死你了
- Oh, you are. Yes, you are. - I missed you...

1278
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,180
喷喷
Oh, Barf...

1279
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,980
不是你
Not you!

1280
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,720
刚才的你
That was some

1281
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,860
驯龙果然很有一套啊
pretty fine dragon-wrangling back there.

1282
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,590
你会是个出色的捕龙猎手
You'd make a good trapper.

1283
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,700
裂颅现在需要找个人
You know... Skullcrusher is gonna need somebody

1284
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,570
照顾他
to look after him now.

1285
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,100
我吗
Me?

1286
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,670
我很荣幸
I'd be honored.

1287
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,810
你父亲
Oh, your father,

1288
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:49,180
会像我一样为你自豪的
he'd be every bit as proud as I am.

1289
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,050
谢谢
Thank you.

1290
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:53,150
你在我身边真是太好了  妈妈
I'm really glad you're here, mom.

1291
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:55,220
我会一直留在你身边的
And here I'll stay.

1292
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,750
看吧
See?

1293
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,220
我就说在这里吧
I told you it was in here.

1294
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,960
你还玩这招呢
You're still doing that one.

1295
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,730
真好笑
That's hilarious.

1296
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:08,230
你给我过来
Come here, you.

1297
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,030
首领归来
The chief has come home!

1298
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,910
首领万岁
Long live the chief!

1299
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:55,180
首领万岁  首领万岁
Long live the chief! Long live the chief!

1300
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:57,350
首领万岁
Long live the chief!

1301
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,170
这里是博克岛
This... is Berk.

1302
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:24,770
有些破烂  有些简陋
A bit trampled and busted

1303
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,310
还有些地方被冰覆盖  但这里是我的家
and covered in ice, but it's home.

1304
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:29,710
是我们的家
It's our home.

1305
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:33,920
过往袭击过我们的敌人
Those who attacked us

1306
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,020
残酷且疯狂
are relentless and crazy.

1307
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,890
但是成功战胜了他们的我们呢
But those who stopped them?

1308
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:41,460
更是勇猛
Oh... even more so!

1309
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:47,330
虽然我们人数不多  但是我们象征着
We may be small in numbers, but we stand for something

1310
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:51,730
这个世界上最强大的东西
bigger than anything the world can pit against us.

1311
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:54,170
我们代表和平的声音
We are the voice of peace.

1312
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:58,240
我们终将一点点改变这个世界
And bit by bit, we will change this world.

1313
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:09,020
我们有他们所缺少的东西
You see, we have something they don't.

1314
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,490
的确  他们有军队
Oh, sure, they have armies,

1315
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:14,190
有舰队  但是我们
and they have armadas, but we...

1316
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:17,190
我们有
We have...

1317
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:19,190
我们的龙
our dragons!
