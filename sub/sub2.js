I mean, I loved hearing what you had to say, it made my day.

203

你看到灯光  表演
You see all this, the lights, the show,

205

观众这些东西了吗
the audience, all that stuff?

206
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,260
要是能有你这样的孩子
I'd give it all up in a heartbeat

207
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,650
我会毫不犹豫地放弃这一切
to have a kid like you.

208
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,780
你真是个混蛋
You're such a jerk.

209
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,110
-女士们你们好吗  -兰德尔  你好吗

You okay?

212

我听说你被人打了
I heard about the beat-down you took.

213
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,010
太野蛮了
Fucking savages.

214
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,380
只是一群孩子罢了  我不该理会他们的
It was just a bunch of kids. I should've left them alone.

215
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,150
不  那样的话他们会抢走你的一切
No, they'll take everything from you if you do that.

216
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,380
外面发生的那些破事  他们都是畜生
All the crazy shit out there? They're animals.

217
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,410

给你的
It's for you.

你得保护好自己
You gotta protect yourself out there,

223
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,340
不然你会很惨
otherwise you're gonna get fucked.

224
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,880

226
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,280

232
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,910
不知道
No idea.

233
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,780
迷你高尔夫对你们来说  是不是标准高尔夫 
Do you people call it miniature golf, or is it just golf to you?

234
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,340
揍他老二  盖瑞
Punch him in the dick, Garry.

235

238
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,790
你的喜剧生涯如何了
How's the comedy career?

239
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,640
你现在是著名单口相声演员了吗
You're a famous stand-up yet?

240
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,910
并不是
Not quite.

241
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
我还在构思段子
Just been working on my material.

242
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,010
别坐了  很快就好
No, don't sit. This will be quick.

243
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,340
听着  我喜欢你  亚瑟
Look. I like you, Arthur.

244
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,180
这里很多人都觉得你是个怪胎
You know, lot of the guys here think you're a freak,

245
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,340
但我喜欢你
but I like you.

246
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,480
我甚至不知道为什么喜欢你
I don't even know why I like you.

247
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,510
但我又收到投诉了
But I got another complaint.

248
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,110
让我有点生气了  肯尼乐器行的人
And it's starting to piss me off. Kenny's Music.

249
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,210
说你消失了
The guy said you disappeared.

250
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,340
连广告牌都没还回去
Never even returned his sign.

251
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,910
因为我被人抢了
Because I got jumped.

252
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,180
你没听说吗
Didn't you hear?

253
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,880
就为一块广告牌吗
For a sign?

254
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,110
扯淡  没道理啊
It's bullshit. It doesn't make sense,

255
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,110
把广告牌还回去
just give him his sign back.

256
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,680
他们都要倒闭了  亚瑟
He's going out of business for God's sake, Arthur.

257
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,640
我要广告牌做什么
Why would I keep that sign?

258
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,380
我他妈怎么知道  问我干嘛
How the fuck do I know? Why does anybody do anything?

259
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,780
你如果不把广告牌还回去
If you don't return the sign,

260
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,050
我只能从你的工资里扣了
I got to take it out of your pay check.

261
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,280
清楚了吗

262
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,240
听着  我是在帮你  知道吗

还有件事
Now I tell you something else.

264
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,380
别的员工觉得跟你待在一起不自在  亚瑟
The other guys, they don't feel comfortable around you, Arthur.

265
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,940
因为他们觉得你是个怪胎  懂吗
Because people think you're weird, okay?

266
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,910
我不能放任不管
And I can't have that around me.

267
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,340
我希望把这事解决了
I want it-I want it to work out---

268
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,980
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

269
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,340
谢谢
Thank you.

270
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,950

271
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,940
这栋楼太烂了  对吗  妈妈

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,480
-晚安  -这栋楼太烂了  对吗
- Goodnight. - This building's so awful, isn't it?

276
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,180
走吧

277
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,640
抬头
Head up.

278
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,180
可能是邮递员把信丢了
Maybe the mailman is throwing them away.

279
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,610
妈妈  为什么这些信对你这么重要
Mom, why are these letters so important to you?

280

-他收到信又会怎样呢  -他会帮我们
- What do you think he's gonna do? - He's gonna help us.

281
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,780
你为他们工作
You worked for them, what?

282
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,080
是三十年前的事情了吧
30 years ago?

283
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,640
他为什么要帮我们
Why would he help us?

284
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,580
因为托马斯·韦恩是个好人
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.

285
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,710
如果他知道我们现在生活得这么困难
If he knew how we were living,

286
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,340
如果他看到这间屋子  他会很难过
if he saw this place, it would make him sick.

287
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,380
我只能这么跟你解释了
I can't explain it to you any better than that.

288
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,910
我不想让你操心钱的事
I don't want you worrying about money.

289
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,980
或是操心我
Or me.

290
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,680
大家都说我已经能给大俱乐部表演单口相声了
Everybody's telling me that my stand-up is ready for the big clubs.

291
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,380
但是  开心  谁让你这么觉得的
But, Happy, what makes you think you could do that?

292
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,310
-什么意思  -我是说
- What do you mean? - I mean...

293
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
要当喜剧演员  难道不需要足够幽默吗
don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?

294
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,080
你叫什么
Hey, what's your name?

295
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
亚瑟
Arthur.

296
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,080
亚瑟
Hey, Arthur.

297
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,050
你的舞跳得真好
You're a really good dancer.

298
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,840
我知道
I know.

299
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,710
那谁跳得不好
And who is not?

300
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,110
他
Him.

301
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,680
开心  什么声音  你没事吧
Happy! What was that? Are you okay?

302
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
妈妈  你说什么
Mom, what?

303
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,040
刚刚的响声  你听到了吗
That noise! Did you hear that noise?

304
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,550
我在看老战争片
I'm-I'm watching an old war movie!

305
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,210
调小声点
Turn it down!

306
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,680
抱歉  妈妈
Sorry, mom.

307
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,910
行了吧
You good?

308
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:47,020
{\an8}威廉街

309
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,910
很高兴看到这些夫妻们来看我的表演
It's nice to see these couples are at my show.

310
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,050
我也有妻子  我们喜欢角色扮演
I have a wife, we love to role play.

311
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,950
没错  很性感
Yes. Yes, very sexy.

312
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,640
我现在最喜欢的是
My favorite one right now is...

313
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,250
教授和需要通过我的课才能毕业的大四学生
professor and senior who really needs to pass my class to graduate.

314
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,310
是的
Yes.

315
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,440
我来告诉你们情境
So I tell you how I operate.

316
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,280
我是新英格兰地区一所著名大学的教授
I'm a professor at a prestigious New England university.

317
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,580
我妻子是我的西方文明导论课上的大四学生
And my wife is a senior in my intro to western civ.

318
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,010
我知道  为什么她大四了还上导论课
I know, I know, why is she-why is she a senior in intro?

319
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,550
我当时也纳闷
I didn't buy it either.

320
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,410
她在我的办公时间来找我
So she comes to me during my office hours,

321
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,010
周一和周三的三点到五点
Monday and Wednesday 3:00 to 5:00,

322
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,210
她说  "打扰一下  路易斯教授"
and she says, "Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

323
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,530
在这个学校里我没法用真的姓氏
I can't use my real last name at this collage

324
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,080
因为他们不雇犹太人
'cause they don't hire Jews.

325
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,880
我要是获得终身教席就有这个问题  先不管这个
Something I'll address once I have a tenure, but for now...

326
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,380
她说  "路易斯教授
She says, "Excuse me, Professor Lewis.

327
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,010
我觉得我的西方文明导论可能要挂科了
I think I might be in danger of failing intro to western civ,

328
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,180
我想让你知道  为了不挂科我什么都愿意做"
and I just want you to know I'm willing to do anything to pass."

329
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,340
我说"什么都愿意做吗"  她说"爽"
I said "anything?", and she says "Aah".

330
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,450
{\an8}保持目光接触
记得观察好笑的事
性笑话总能使观众笑

331
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,080
{\an8}心理疾病

332
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,440
{\an8}人们

333
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,150
{\an8}人们希望你

334
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:53,010
{\an8}有心理疾病最糟的是
人们希望你假装没病

335
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,250
你今天是不是跟踪我了
Were you following me today?

336
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,750
是的
Yeah.

337
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,840
我就知道是你
I thought that was you.

338
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,510
我还以为你会入室抢劫
I was hoping you'd come in and rob the place.

339
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,980
我有一把枪
I have a gun.

340
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,610
我明天再造访
I'll come by tomorrow.

341
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,940
你太幽默了  亚瑟
You're so funny, Arthur.

342
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
是啊
Yeah...

343
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,180
我是单口相声演员
You know, I--I do stand-up comedy.

344
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,110
有机会的话可以来看我的表演
You should maybe come and see a show sometime.

345
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,910
没问题
I could do that.

346
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,180
是吗
Yeah?

347
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,410
嗯  告诉我时间
Yeah. You let me know when?

348
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,310
好
Yeah.

我爱这份工作
I love this job.

364

亚瑟  我得知道你为什么带枪去儿童医院
Arthur, I need to know why you brought a gun into a kids hospital.

365
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,750
这是道具  这是我表演的一部分
It's a prop. It's part of my act now.

366
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,910

- Randall told you that? - You're a fuck-up, Arthur.

370
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,250
还是个骗子

你被开除了
You're fired!

372
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,580
我跟你说  她想要我的号码
I'm telling you, she wanted my number.

373
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,770
我们不该走的
We should have just stayed.

374
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,600
你在做梦吧  她对你根本不感兴趣
You're dreaming, man. She wasn't interested... at all.

375
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,010
你疯了吗  你没看到我们跳舞时挨得多近吗
Are you nuts? Did you see how close we were dancing!?

376

00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,980
亚瑟  我听说了你的遭遇
Hey, Arthur. I heard what happened.

417
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,210
我很遗憾  伙计
Sorry, mate.

418
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,560
是啊  那样被开除
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair,

419
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,210
感觉并不公平
you get fired like that.

420
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,120
你真的带枪去儿童医院了吗  亚瑟
Did you really bring a gun to the children's hospital, Arty?

421
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,890
你他妈为什么要那么做
What the fuck would you do that for?

422
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,350
这是你新表演的一部分吗  亚瑟
Is that part of your new act, Arthur?

423
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,550
如果你的舞蹈没把人逗笑
If your dancing doesn't do the trick,

424
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,910
你就开枪自杀吗
you just gonna shoot yourself?

425
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,110
怎么不问问兰德尔
Why don't you ask Randall about it?

426
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,910
是他的枪
It was his gun.

427
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,140
-什么  -为此我还欠你人情  不是吗
- What? - I still owe you for that, don't I?

428
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,840
你他妈在说什么
What the fuck are you talking about?

429
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,400
别胡扯了  亚瑟
Stop talking outta your ass, Art!

430
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,590
不
Oh, no!

431
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,010
我忘了打卡下班了
I forgot to punch out.

432
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,590
{\an8}别忘了笑

433
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:07,480
{\an8}别笑

434
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,050
我们的城市正试图弄清楚
And as our city tries to make sense of the brutal

435
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,320
上周在地铁上发生的三人命案
triple murder on the subway last week.

436
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,090
我们请来了托马斯·韦恩
We're joined by Thomas Wayne.

437
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,180
-开心  托马斯·韦恩上电视了  -他跟这起悲剧
- Happy, look. Thomas Wayne's on TV. - He has a personal connection

438
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,000
-有私人关联  -听到了  妈妈
- this tragedy. - Yes, mother.

439
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,180
感谢邀请我参加节目
Thanks for having me on show.

440
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,050
他们在问他那个可怕的地铁谋杀案
They're asking him about those horrible subway murders.

441
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,520
谢谢你  托马斯  我知道这对你来说并不容易
Thank you, Thomas. I know this is a difficult time for you.

442
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,400
-为什么问他  -这些年轻人都是...
- Why him? - These young men all were...

443
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,850
像是在给竞选造势
Looks like his compaign.

444
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,890
是的  他们三个都是韦恩投资公司的员工
Yes, all three of them worked for Wayne Investments.

445
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,390
{\an8}托马斯·韦恩

446
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,640
他们善良  正直  有教养
Good, decent, educated,

447
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,880
尽管我与他们三人没有私交
although, I didn't know any of them personally.

448
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,030
和所有在韦恩公司工作过或正在工作的员工一样
Like all the Wayne employees, past and present,

449
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,050
他们都是我的家人
they were family.

450
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,190
-听到了吧  我就说我们是一家人  -这座城市
- You hear that! I told you. We're family. - There now seems to be a

451
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,900
现在似乎仇富情绪高涨
groundswell of anti-rich sentiment in the city.

452
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,410
似乎那些不那么富裕的市民
It's almost as if our less fortunate residents

453
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,250
选择站在凶手这边
are taken the side of the killer.

454
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,750
是的  令人遗憾
Yes and it's a shame.

455
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,000
这也是我考虑参选市长的其中一个原因
It's one of the reasons why I'm considering a run for mayor.

456
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,250
高谭市迷失了方向
Gotham has lost its way.

457
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,390
你对于有目击者声称
What about the eyewitness report

458
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,370
嫌疑人戴着小丑面具有什么看法
of the suspect being a man in a clown mask?

459
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,420
我觉得很合理
Well, it makes total sense to me.

460
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,190
什么样的懦夫才做得出这般冷血行径
What kind of a coward would do something that cold-blooded ?

461
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,570
躲在面具后的人
Someone who hides behind a mask.

462
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:18,560
这种人嫉妒比自己幸运的人
Someone who is envious of those more fortunate than themselves,

463
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,570
却不敢露出自己的真面目
yet they're too scared to show their own face.

464
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,830
在这种人改过自新之前
And until all those kind of people change for the better..

465
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,070
我们这些有所成就的人
those of us who've made something of our lives,

466
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,950
将会一直把这些一事无成的人
will always look at those who haven't

467
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,320
看作跳梁小丑
as nothing but clowns.

468
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,030
托马斯·韦恩  感谢你接受采访
Thomas Wayne, thank you for coming in this morning.

469
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,200
这不好笑
It's not funny.

470
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,210
我那天在收音机里听到这首歌了
I heard this song on the radio the other day.

471
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,260
那个家伙唱着
And the guy was singing,

472
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,860
说他的名字叫嘉年华
that his name was Carnival.

473
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,430
-亚瑟  -太疯狂了
- Arthur. - It's just crazy,

474
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,270
因为这是我工作时的小丑昵称
because that's my clown name. At work.

475
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,730
直到不久前
But until a while ago

476
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,690
好像都没人注意到我
it was like nobody ever saw me.

477
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,330
连我都不确定自己是否真的存在
Even I didn't know if I really existed.

478
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,490
亚瑟  我有坏消息要告诉你
Arthur, I have some bad news for you.

479
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,000
你根本没听  对吧
You don't listen, do you?

480
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,480
我觉得你从来都没
I don't think you ever

481
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,820
认真听我说话
really hear me.

482
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,470
你只是每周重复同样的问题
You just ask the same questions every week:

483
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,880
"工作顺利吗"
"How's your job?"

484
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,290
"有没有消极的想法"
"Are you having any negative thoughts?"

485
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,420
我脑袋里全是消极的想法
All I have are negative thoughts.

486
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,430
反正你也听不进去
But you don't listen, anyway.

487
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,050
我说了
I said,

488
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,180
我这辈子
for my whole life

489
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,700
都不确定自己是否真的存在
I didn't know if I even really existed.

490
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,400
但现在我确定了
But I do.

491
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,410
人们开始注意到我了
And people are starting to notice.

492
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,950
他们砍了我们的预算
They've cut our funding.

493
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,650
我们下周就要关闭了
We're closing down our offices next week.

494
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,060
市政府在大幅度削减预算
The city's cut funding across the board,

495
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,980
其中包括社会福利
social services is part of that.

496
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,060
这是我们最后一次见面了
This is the last time we will be meeting.

497
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:28,930
好吧
Okay.

498
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,950
他们根本不在乎你这种人  亚瑟
They don't give a shit about people like you, Arthur.

499
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,930
他们也不在乎我这种人
And they really don't give a shit about people like me, either.

500
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,370
操
Oh, fuck.

501
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,320
以后我该怎么拿药
How am I supposed to get my medication now?

502
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,700
我该去找谁
Who do I talk to?

503
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,180
抱歉  亚瑟
I'm sorry, Arthur.

504
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,800
我想大多数女人把性事看作是买车
I think, uh-- I think most women look at sex like buying a car.

505
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,770
就好比"这车我能长久开下去吗"
You know, like, "Can I see myself in this long term?"

506
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,610
安全吗  可靠吗
Is it safe? Is it reliable?

507
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,250
会害死我吗
Could it kill me?

508
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,420
而大多数男人把性事看作是停车
Most guys look at sex like parking a car.

509
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,960
比如"这儿有个车位"
We're like "There's a spot".

510
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,950
"那边还有一个  那边也行"
"There is another spot, that would work."

511
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,870
"还得花钱呢  那算了"
"Oh, I have to pay? Never mind."

512
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,490
"残障人士专用  希望没人看到"
"Handicapped? Hope no one sees us."

513
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,540
好了我讲完了  谢谢各位
Alright that's my time. Thank you very much, guys.

514
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,390
大家再次为山姆·莫尔鼓掌
One more time, Sam Mohr, ya' all.

515
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,510
下一位喜剧演员
Alright, this next comic

516
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,100
说自己在哥谭市住了一辈子
describes himself as a lifelong Gotham resident

517
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,610
从小就有人经常对他说
who from a young age was always told that:

518
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,920
"他人生的意义就是
"His purpose in life was to

519
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,750
为这个寒冷黑暗的世界带来笑声"
bring laughter and joy into this cold, dark world."

520
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,500
好吧
Okay.

521
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,570
请掌声欢迎亚瑟·弗莱克  亚瑟·弗莱克
Please help me welcome Arthur Fleck, ya'all. Arthur Fleck.

522
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,830
大家好  很高兴来到这里
Hello, it's good to be here---

523
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,830
我讨厌
I hate--

524
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,370
我小时候
I---I hated

525
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,970
讨厌上学
school as a kid.

526
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,220
我小时候讨厌上学
I hated school as a-- as a kid.

527
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,920
但我母亲总是对我说
But my mother would always say,

528
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,190
"你应该享受校园生活  你早晚要为生计奔波"
"You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living."

529
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,710
"不会的  妈  我要当喜剧演员"
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"

530
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,640
来个好笑的
Here is one.

531
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,810
那天我正好在想
You know, I was just thinking the other day,

532
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,140
有钱人为什么都...
why are the rich people so---

533
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,770
{\an8}杀手小丑逍遥法外
杀人凶手的最新消息

534
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,390
你相信他们说的吗
Do you believe that shit?

535
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,160
{\an8}义警小丑?
九号列车发生暴力事件
据称三人因争执被杀

536
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,180
去他们的
Fuck 'em!

537
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,340
我认为这个人是个英雄
I think the guy that did it is a hero.

538
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,760
哥谭市少了三个混蛋  还剩下一百万个
Three less pricks in Gotham city, only a million more to go.

539
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,780
我知道你们会怎么想
I know what you're gonna be thinking.

540
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,830
伙计  像往常一样  谢谢你带来的欢笑
And buddy, as always thanks for the laughs.

541
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,380
我们当然会再见面  你会来对吧  希望你会来
Sure, will see you again. You will be here, right? I hope.

542
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,880
明晚的嘉宾有戴安娜·哈德森
Tomorrow night, we have Diana Hudson,

544
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,710
感谢各位观看
Thanks for watching.

545
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
晚安  千万别忘记
Good night. And always remember

546
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,930
"这就是人生"
"That's Life".

547
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,230
这就是人生
That's life.

548
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,350
妈妈  醒醒  我们去床上睡
Mom, time to wake up. We go to bed.

549
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,720
不  开心
No, Happy.

550
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,070
我又给他写了封信
I wrote him a new letter.

拍下了这段视频
right here in Gotham.

687
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,690
有个人觉得只要他自己不停地笑
Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep laughing,

688
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,390
自己就搞笑了
it'll somehow make you funny.

689

我小时候讨厌上学
I hated school as a kid.

692
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,190
但我母亲总是对我说
But my mother would always say,

693
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,430
"你应该享受校园生活

"不会的  妈  我要当喜剧演员"
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"

696
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,090
你真该听妈妈的话
You should have listened to your mother.

697
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,160
再来一段  再来一段  鲍比

很搞笑
It's funny.

700
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,990
我小时候
When I was a little boy

701
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,190
跟人们说我要当喜剧演员
and told people I was gonna be a comedian,

702
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,450
大家都笑我
everyone laughed at me.

703
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,750
可是现在没人笑了
Well, no one's laughing now.

704
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,820
这话说得没错  伙计
You can say that again, pal.

705
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,820
好了

709
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,400
{\an8}杀死富人
是新运动吗

710
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,760
随着大都会附近紧张局势不断加剧

他们大多扮成小丑
took the streets today

720
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:27,830
为了对抗城市精英  他们策划了多场示威活动
in one of the several plan demonstrations taking on the city's elite,

721
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,360
{\an8}抗议

01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:32,060
包括明晚韦恩大宅慈善活动门外的大型集会

723
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,790
你们抗议的目的是什么
What's the point of all this?

724
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,190
富人去死  托马斯·韦恩去死
Fuck the rich! Fuck Thomas Wayne.

725
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,960
这就是我们抗议的目的

整个体制都去死

729
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,090
你或许还记得  正是托马斯·韦恩

730
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,220
率先将许多哥谭市民称为"小丑"

731
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,630
{\an8}托马斯·韦恩竞选市长

732
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,660
{\an8}这个小丑让我不满  小丑竞选市长

733
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,390
至今他也没有表示歉意
Today, he offered little in way of an apology.

734
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,490
{\an8}韦恩  法西斯

735
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:57,660
{\an8}托马斯·韦恩

736
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,930
我要说的是
Well, what I will say is,

737
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,360
这些人有毛病
there's something wrong with those people.

738
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,660
我会帮助他们
And I'm here to help them.

739
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,830
我会帮助他们摆脱贫穷
I'm gonna lift them out of poverty,

740
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,360
帮助改善他们的生活

这就是我竞选的原因

742
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,660
他们或许没意识到  但我是他们唯一的希望
They may not realize it, but I'm their only hope.

743
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,030
{\an8}我们都是小丑

744
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,490

01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,850
有事吗  伙计
Can I help you, pal?

752
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,390
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

753
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,920
你想要签名什么的吗
Do you want an autograph or something?

754
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,560
不
No.

潘妮·弗莱克是我母亲
Penny Fleck is my mother.

757
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:31,920
老天
Jesus.

758
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,990
昨天来我家的人就是你吗
You're the guy that came to my house yesterday?

759
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,090
是的
Yes.

760
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,930
抱歉我不请自来
I'm sorry I just showed up.

761
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:41,750
但是我母亲告诉了我一切
But my mother told me everything.

762
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,490
我必须找你谈谈
And I had to talk to you,

763
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:45,430
-对吧  -听着  我不是你父亲
- you know? - Look, pal, I'm not your father.

764
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,020
你什么毛病
What's wrong with you?

765
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:50,060
瞧瞧我们两个
Look at us.

766
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,190
-我觉得你就是  -那不可能
- I think you are. - Well, that's impossible.

767
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,190
因为你是被收养的  而我从没和你妈上过床
Because you were adopted and I never slept with your mother.

768
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,860
-我不是被收养的  -你想要什么  钱吗
- I wasn't adopted. - What do you want from me, money?

769
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,990
不  不是
No. I don't.

770
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,170
我不是被收养的
I wasn't adopted.

771
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,950
老天  她从没告诉你吗
Jesus. She never told you?

772
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,790
告诉我什么
Told me what?

773
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,360
你母亲在为我们工作期间收养了你
Your mother adopted you while she was working for us.

774
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,760
这不是真的  你为什么这么说
That's not true. Why are you saying that?

775
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,530
因为她在你还小的时候被捕
Because she was arrested and committed to Arkham State Hospital

776
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,060
并被关进阿卡姆州立医院
when you were just a little boy.

777
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,320
你为什么这么说
Why are you saying this?

778
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,760
我不需要你骗我  我知道这很奇怪
I don't need you to tell me lies. I know it seems strange.

779
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,430
我无意惹你不快
I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.

780
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,290
我不明白为什么大家都这么没礼貌
I don't know why everyone is so rude,

781
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:27,060
为什么你也是这样  我不想从你那得到什么
and I don't why you are, I don't want anything from you.

782
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,630
或许一点点温暖  或许一个拥抱  爸爸
Maybe a little bit of warmth, maybe a hug, dad!

783
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,690
连一点点尊重都不舍得吗
How much is a little bit of fucking decency?

784
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,190
你们这些人是怎么回事
What is it with you people?!

785
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,060
你说那些话侮辱我母亲
You say that staff about my mother?

786
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,720
-她是个疯子  -她...
- She's crazy. - She's--

787
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,690
-你觉得这很好笑吗  -是的
- You think this is funny? - Yeah--

788
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:51,420
爸爸  是我
Dad, it's me!

789
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,500
拜托
Come on--

790
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,120
你再碰我儿子  我就杀了你
You touch my son again, I'll fucking kill you!

791
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,720

是啊  有些是
Yeah. Some have.

831
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,760
有些只是疯了  对他们自己或他人构成危险
You know. Some are just crazy and pose a danger to themselves or others.

832

还有些人无处可去

833
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,790
不知该怎么办
Don't know what to do, you know?

834

是啊  我明白你的意思  老兄

835
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,620
有时候  我也不知道该怎么办

上一次我把怨气撒在了别人身上
Last time I ended up taking it out on some people.

你懂我的意思吧

01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,590
想要一直开心真的是...
It's so hard just to try and be...

843
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,260
太难了

844

848
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,890
我不知道该和你说什么
I don't know what to tell you,

849
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,820
不过你应该去看看心理咨询师
but you should see somebody.

850
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,660
政府有相关项目  市民服务之类的

851
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,790

危害自己小孩的安危...

860
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:29,260
怎么了
What?

861
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,260
你说她是你的母亲
You said she's your mother?

862
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,330
抱歉  伙计
I'm sorry, man.

863
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,990

Like I said, I can't release these records, you know,

864
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,430
我不能给你这些记录
without the proper forms.

865
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,660
我会被连累的
I--I could get in trouble.

866
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,930
如果你能把你母亲带来签字
Look, if you wanna bring your mom in here to sign,

867
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:51,760
手续会更好办
that would be much easier,

868
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,820
但我不能不经签字批准就给文件  懂吗
but, I can't-- I can't let this go without a signature, okay?

869
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:56,220
抱歉
I'm sorry.

870
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:01,620

都是托马斯编的瞎话
Thomas had them all made up,

884
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,760
好继续隐瞒这事

我他妈这辈子...
I haven't been happy...

我在庆祝
I'm celebrating.

965
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,460
对  我们听说了
Right. We heard.

966
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,520
所以我们才来的  觉得...
That's-- that's why we came by. Figured...

967
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,520
你可能需要一点安慰
you could use some cheering up.

968
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,260
真体贴
That's sweet.

969
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:48,350
但不用
But, no.

970
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,790
我感觉很好
I feel good.

971
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,220
我停药了

So, hey, listen. Uh, I don't know if you're heard, but..

975
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,400
警察来了店里好几次
the cops had been calling around the shop

976
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,810
问地铁谋杀案
talking all the guys about

977
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:10,960
相关的事情
those subway murders.

978
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,080
他们没问我
They didn't talk to me.

979
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,490
因为嫌犯是正常身材
That's because the suspect was a regular sized person.

980
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,480
如果嫌犯是个侏儒  你现在就该进监狱了
If it was a fucking midget you'd be in jail right now.

981
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,140

他们问过你了
they talked to you and

984
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,180
现在他们在调查我
now they're looking for me---

985
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,880
我就是想知道你说了什么
I just want to know what you said.

1055
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,730
不必在意称呼
That's all bullshit.

1056

我什么都不信
I don't believe in anything.

1065
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,390
我只是觉得这妆会很适合我的表演
I just thought it would be good for my act.

1066

the audience is gonna go crazy if you put this guy on.

Maybe, maybe for a bit, but not a whole segment.

01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,870
-什么  -介绍我出场的时候
- Yeah? - When you bring me out

1086
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,420
你能叫我"小丑"吗
can you introduce me as "Joker"?

1087
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,950
你为什么不用真名
What's wrong with your real name?

1088
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,950
你之前在节目上就是这么叫我的
That's what you called me on the show.

1089
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,260
一个小丑
A Joker.

1090
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,550
你还记得吗
Do you remember?

1091
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:28,790
-是吗  -我不知道
- Did I? - Yeah, I don't know.

1092
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:31,330
听你的  孩子  你就是小丑了
Well, if you say so, kid, you know, joker it is.

1093
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:33,780
-这名字挺好的  -谢了  默里
- It's good. - Thanks, Murray.

1094
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:41,160
{\an8}{\an8}挂上笑脸

1095
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,510
我愿意试试
I would try it, you know,

1096
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,880
但我不确定我老婆会同意我这么干
but I'm not sure my wife would let me do it.

1097
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,740
可能我下一个老婆会同意
Maybe my next wife.

1098
01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:07,050
你们得见见我们的下一位来宾
You gotta see our next guest for yourself.

1099

我相信这个家伙需要看医生
I'm pretty sure this guy can use a doctor.

1100
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,130
他有性方面的问题吗
Does he have a sexual problem?

1101
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:14,610
他看起来可不止有一个问题
He looks like he's got a lot of problems.

1102
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,380
好了  让我们再最后看一遍那段视频
Alright, Let's show that clip one last time.

1103
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:28,970
我小时候讨厌上学
I hated school as a kid.

1104
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,080
但我母亲总是对我说
But my mother would always say,

1105
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,220
"你应该享受校园生活
"You should enjoy it.

1106
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,880
你早晚要为生计奔波"
One day you'll have to work for a living."

1107
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:40,740
"不会的  妈  我要当喜剧演员"
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"

1108
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:47,810
好了
Okay,

1109
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:53,910
你们可能看过下一位嘉宾的这段视频
you may have seen that clip of our next guest.

1110
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,500
在他出场前  我只想说
Now, before he comes out, I just want to say

1111
01:37:56,510 --> 01:38:00,190
我们都对今夜本市发生的状况感到心痛
that we're all heartbroken about what's going on in the city tonight.

1112
01:38:00,190 --> 01:38:02,660
但这是他选择的出场方式
But, this is how he wanted to come out.

1113
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:06,000
而且说实话  我觉得我们都需要好好笑一场
And, honestly, I think we could all use a good laugh.

1114
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,570
那么  有请"小丑"登场
So, please welcome "Joker".

1115
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:52,630
你还好吗  医生
Are you alright, doctor?

1116
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,590
这个出场可真厉害
Well, that was... quite an entrance.

1117
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,330
你没事吧
You okay?

1118
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,670
我很好
Oh, yeah.

1119
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:13,490
这和我想象的一模一样
This is exactly how I imagined it.

1120
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:16,850
我的想象可不是这样
Well, that makes one of us.

1121
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,380
你能和我们聊聊你这身打扮吗
So, can you tell us about this look?

1122
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:27,930
我们之前聊的时候  你说过
When we spoke earlier, you mentioned

1123
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:30,830
你的装扮不是在表达政治观点  对吧
that this look is not a political statement, is that right?

1124
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,900
没错  默里  我不关心政治
That's right, Murray. I'm not political.

1125
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,250
我只是想让大家笑出来
I'm just trying to make people laugh.

1126
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,940
你觉得你干得怎么样
And how's that goin' for ya?

1127
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:47,430
没事  我知道你是个喜剧演员
It's alright. It's alright. So, I know you're a comedian.

1128
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,440
最近有什么新的段子吗
Have you been working on any new material?

1129
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,950
你想给大家讲个笑话吗
You want to tell us a joke?

1130
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,160
想听吗
Yeah?

1131
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,350
好呀
Okay.

1132
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:07,800
他还带了个本子
He's got a book.

1133
01:40:08,990 --> 01:40:10,820
笑话本子
A book of jokes.

1134
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,230
{\an8}默里·富兰克林现场秀

1135
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:16,500
{\an8}我只希望我的死亡比我的人生更有"价值"

1136
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,890
不着急  我们有一整晚的时间
Take your time. We got all night.

1137
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,380
好  我找到一个
Okay. Okay. Here's one.

1138
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:34,970
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

1139
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,620
就这你也要翻本子找
And you had to look that up?

1140
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:45,640
我想把这个笑话讲好
I wanted to get it right.

1141
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,330
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

1142
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,960
谁啊
Who's there?

1143
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,060
是警察  女士
It's the police, ma'am.

1144
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,170
你儿子被酒驾司机撞了
Your son has been hit by a drunk driver.

1145
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,380
他死了
He's dead.

1146
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,130
不不不
Oh, no, no, no!

1147
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,190
你不能拿这个开玩笑
No, you cannot joke about that.

1148
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:06,230
是啊  这不好笑  亚瑟
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1149
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:09,010
我们的节目不开这种玩笑
That's not the kind of humor we do on this show.

1150
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:11,690
好吧  我...我很抱歉
Okay, I'm s... Yeah, I'm sorry.

1151
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:13,190
只不过
It's just, you know,

1152
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:16,510
我这几周很不好过  默里
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

1153
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,340
自从我...
Ever since I

1154
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:24,580
杀了那几个华尔街精英之后
killed those three Wall Street guys.

1155
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:32,740
好吧  我还在等笑点
Okay. I'm waiting for the punchline.

1156
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:35,700
没有笑点
There is no punchline.

1157
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:38,740
这不是开玩笑
It's not a joke.

1158
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:44,910
你认真的吗
You're serious, aren't you?

1159
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:47,800
你是说地铁上那三个年轻人是你杀的
You're telling us you killed those three young men on the subway?

1160
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,560
我们为什么要信你
And why should we believe you?

1161
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,580
我现在一无所有
I've got nothing left to lose.

1162
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,350
没有什么能再伤害我了
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1163
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,770
我的人生就是一场喜剧
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1164
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:06,870
让我理一理
Let me get this straight,

1165
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:09,800
你觉得杀了那些人很好笑吗
you think that killing those guys is funny?

1166
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:11,360
没错
I do.

1167
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:14,560
而且我受够了假装不好笑
And I'm tired of pretending it's not.

1168
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,020
喜剧是很主观的  默里
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1169
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,420
大家不都这么说吗
Isn't that what they say?

1170
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,340
你们所有人
All of you,

1171
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:23,600
你们的体制无作不知
the system that knows so much,

1172
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,570
你们决定是非对错
you decide what's right or wrong

1173
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:30,810
同样的  你们也决定什么好笑
the same way that you decide what's funny...

1174
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,270
或不好笑
or not.

1175
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,440
把他赶下去
Get him off!

1176
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,600
好吧  我可能理解你了
Well, okay, I--I think I might understand that you

1177
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,410
你这样做是为了发起一场运动
did this to start a movement,

1178
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:42,880
成为一种象征
to become a symbol.

1179
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:44,660
拜托  默里
Come on, Murray,

1180
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:47,350
我看起来像那种可以发起运动的小丑吗
do I look like the kind of a clown that could start a movement?

1181
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:50,490
我杀人  是因为他们是人渣
I killed those guys because they were awful.

1182
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,550
这年头人人都是人渣
Everybody's awful these days.

1183
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:55,790
足以逼疯任何人
It's enough to make anyone crazy.

1184
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:58,480
这么说你是疯子  这就是你
Okay. So that's it, you're crazy. That's your defense

1185
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,210
杀死三个年轻人的理由吗
for killing three young men?

1186
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:01,780
不是
Nah.

1187
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:06,380
他们连首歌都唱不好  所以才会丧命
They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives.

1188
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,240
为什么大家都为他们难过
Why is everybody so upset about these guys?

1189
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:15,280
如果是我死在路边  你们连看都不会看
If it was me dying on the side-walk, you'd walk right over me.

1190
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,280
我每天从你们身边走过  没人注意我  但是他们
I pass you everyday and you don't notice me! But these guys,

1191
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:21,810
托马斯·韦恩在电视上哭诉几句  你们就关心了
what, because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV?

1192
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,810
你对托马斯·韦恩也有意见
Well, you have a problem with Thomas Wayne,too?

1193
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:25,480
是的
Yes, I do.

1194
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:29,540
你见过外面的世界吗  默里
Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray?

1195
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:32,240
你真的离开过演播室吗
Do you ever actually leave the studio?

1196
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:36,740
每个人都对彼此大喊大叫
Everybody just yells and screams at each other.

1197
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,650
根本没人有礼貌
Nobody's civil anymore!

1198
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:42,310
根本没人设身处地为他人着想
Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.

1199
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:45,380
你认为托马斯·韦恩那种人
You think men like Thomas Wayne

1200
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:48,350
考虑过我这种人的感受吗
ever think what it's like to be someone like me?

1201
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:51,280
考虑除了自己以外的人  不会的
To be somebody but themselves? They don't.

1202
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,340
他们认为我们会像听话的小孩一样
They think that we'll just sit there and take it

1203
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:56,180
忍气吞声  默默承受
like good little boys!

1204
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:58,680
我们不会翻脸发狂
That we won't werewolf and go wild.

1205
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,850
说完了吗
You finished?

1206
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:02,710
你也太自怜自哀了  亚瑟
I mean, there is so much self-pity, Arthur.

1207
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:06,010
听起来像是在为杀死那些年轻人找借口
You sound like you're making excuses for killing those young men.

1208
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:09,410
这话我可以告诉你  并不是人人都是人渣
Not everybody-- and I'll tell you this-- not everyone is awful.

1209
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:13,980
-但你是人渣  默里  -我吗
- But you're awful, Murray. - Me?

1210
01:44:14,110 --> 01:44:16,710
我是人渣  是吗  怎么说
I'm awful? Oh, yeah? How am I awful?

1211
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,510
播放我的视频
Playing my video,

1212
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:23,610
邀请我上节目
inviting me on the show---

1213
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,580
你只是想取笑我
You just wanted to make fun of me.

1214
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:30,210
你跟他们没有区别
You're just like the rest of 'em.

1215
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:32,480
你根本不了解我  伙计
You don't know the first thing about me, pal.

1216
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,340
看看因为你的所作所为而导致的后果
Look what happened because of what you did, what it led to.

1217
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:37,040
全城都暴动了
There are riots out there.

1218
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,780
两名警察命悬一线  而你却在笑
Two policemen are in critical condition and you're laughing.

1219
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:42,310
你还在笑  因为你的所作所为
You're laughing. Someone was killed today

1220
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:43,880
今天有人被杀了
because of what you did.

1221
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:44,910
我知道
I know.

1222
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,340
再来个笑话怎么样  默里
How about a another joke, Murray?

1223
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,210
不  我们已经听够你的笑话了
No, I think we got enough of your jokes.

1224
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:52,640
-如果你  -别讲了
- What do you get... - I don't think so.

1225
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:56,540
惹恼了一个被社会鄙视抛弃的
when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a society

1226
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,810
孤独的精神病  会发生什么
that abandons him and treats him like trash?

1227
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,740
吉恩  报警
Call the police, Gene.

1228
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:01,380
-我告诉你会发生什么  -报警
- I'll tell you what you get. - Call the police!

1229
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,510
你会自食其果
You get what you fucking deserve!

1230
