What to Do When You Have a Bully in the Classroom
Teachers     
Bullying is an unfortunately common occurrence in schools, and for a classroom teacher it can be challenging to 

know what to do. However, there are steps to take to help manage the situation when you find yourself with a 

bully in your classroom.

Bullying

As a teacher, bullying is, unfortunately, something we all have to deal with during our careers. Regardless of 

the age of students you teach, it finds its way into the classroom. It could be younger children; it might be 

more verbal or physical; and it happens in the hallway, lunchroom, or playground. As students grow older, the 

bullying gets more sophisticated and can involve text messaging and social media. The National Center for 

Education Stastistics reports that in 2013, nearly twenty-two percent of students reported being bullied in 

school. Whether the bullying is physically taking place in school or not, it can be difficult for educators to 

know what to do to handle the situation. However, if you have a plan of action, you can keep your cool and 

handle it appropriately for all students.

Start Conversations

Sometimes as teachers we want to be superheroes, and in our minds, we think that we have the whole situation 

under control. However, the last thing you want to do when you start to suspect you have a bully in the 

classroom is to keep it to yourself. Start by having conversations with your administrator and guidance 

counselor, because bullying is a pattern of behavior, not a single isolated incident. Your administrator and 

guidance counselor will have procedures they need to follow to evaluate the situation. There are things they 

will want, and not want, you to do in this situation based on laws and your school district's guidelines. 

However, in spite of this, there are things you can do in your classroom to stop the bully from impacting your 

students and their learning as much as possible.

Reestablish Safe Environments

Let's say you have a bully in the classroom. For many students, whether the bullying is directed at them or one 

of their friends, the classroom can suddenly feel like an unsafe place. It causes emotional distress and can 

make it physically impossible for students to learn. As a result, when you have a bully in the classroom you 

often need to take deliberate steps to regain control of the space and create a safe classroom environment 

again.

The first step is to go back to what you do in the first days of school and reestablish classroom expectations 

in regards to respect and responsibility. In terms of respect, this means first and foremost modeling for you 

students how you expect them to speak to yourself and one another. A good way to start this is through simple 

role playing.

For example, you might start simply by role playing with students about their likes and dislikes. Show them how 

to respond to people who disagree with their opinions in a positive manner starting with safe topics such as 

books and movies. If you want to delve into more serious role playing, enlist your guidance counselor to help 

you. They will have access to resources to help you guide role playing with your students in various types of 

bullying situations that are appropriate to the age of students in your classroom.

Deal with the Bully

Even if you, and your administrator, decide a child is engaging in bullying behavior -remember that they are 

still a child. You want to be careful to not stigmatize or ostracize the child in front of their peers. First, 

this often just increases their bullying behavior both inside and outside of the classroom. Second, it does very 

little to stop the child's bullying behavior.

So when you see the bullying behavior, try to engage them in a private conversation about the situation. Address 

the behavior, but try to keep your tone and choice of words as positive as possible. First and foremost, listen 

and let them tell their side of a story. In bullying situations, there are often many other issues going on with 

the child. You have to be a good listener if you want them to engage in the conversation and truly change the 

behaviors. This means trying to avoid putting on our stern teacher voices. Don't lecture, but rather probe them 

with questions such as 'How would you feel if someone did that to you or someone you care about?' You may need 

to engage other adults in the conversation with the child as well.

Next, find opportunities to reward positive behaviors in all of your students. For example, if Sam offers 

Charlie a pencil because he can't find one, praise it. Say 'Thank you for sharing.' Finding little opportunities 

like this one to reinforce acts of kindness helps show the bullying child there are greater rewards in kindness 

versus meanness. Building a culture of kindness in your classroom is a great way to help counteract the 

negativity caused by bullying behaviors. The United States Department of Health & Human Services' stop bullying 

program recommends a ratio of five positive affirmations for every one negative criticism.

Teach the Class Conflict Resolution

When you have a bully in the classroom, conflicts will spring up quite often. Sometimes they will directly 

involve the bully, while other times they may stem from the emotions of students who are watching the bullying 

occur. So when you have a bully in the classroom, one strategy that helps both the bully and the rest of your 

class is to teach conflict management strategies. These strategies will help everyone cope with the stress 

bullying creates in your classroom.

Scholastic's website offers a detailed guide to working through the conflict resolution process with students in 

your classroom. Start by setting up space in your room where students can go to 'cool down'. That way if your 

students find themselves in conflict with the bully, they have a place to escape and decompress from the 

situation. Once everyone has calmed down, create a forum for the students to explain what happened without using 

negative language, or put downs. Once both sides have been heard, have the students discuss the feelings 

involved. This is particularly important because bullying is all about emotions. Your classroom bully is often 

trying to make himself feel better at the expense of another student's emotions. Therefore, the discussion of 

feelings is a critical part of airing emotions that arise when you are managing a bully in the classroom. At 

that point, students will be ready to brainstorm ways to resolve the situation.

Managing a Bully

Having a bully in your classroom is a complicated and emotional situation for you and your students. The first 

step is always to include your administrator and guidance counselor as part of the solution. Use them as 

resources as you work to reestablish your classroom as a safe environment for all of your students. Work to 

develop strategies to manage the bully's behavior inside your classroom, and teach the whole class how to deal 

with the situation.
